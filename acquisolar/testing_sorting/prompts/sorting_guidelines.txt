Here are details for the sorting of "Document_folder_path": 
1. Do not create new folders. 
2. Documents should be classified based on their primary content and purpose, adhering to the definitions provided for each category:

- "Interconnection Agreement": Contains contracts and agreements detailing the conditions for connecting the solar project to the power grid, including technical specifications and responsibilities.

- "Interconnection Agreement Supplementary Documents": Houses additional materials that support or elaborate on the main interconnection agreements, like technical studies and correspondence.

- "Site Control": Includes legal documents affirming rights over the land intended for solar development, such as leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

- "PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)": Features agreements between the project developer and an off-taker for the purchase of power generated by the solar project, outlining prices, terms, and delivery standards.

- "PPA Supplementary Documents": Comprises documents that provide further details or context to the PPAs, including amendments, technical specifications, PPA application, communication about the PPA, Exhibit or Annex, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Agreements and insurance documents.

3. When uncertain about a document's classification, prioritize understanding the document's essence and main purpose to guide its placement. If a document significantly pertains to more than one category but has a primary focus, classify it according to its main focus.
