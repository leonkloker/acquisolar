    2. Classify documents with precision, using these category definitions:

        ""Interconnection Agreement"": Contains contracts and agreements for connecting the solar project to the power grid. Look for phrases like ""the interconnection customer agrees"" and ""interconnection requests"".

        ""Site Control"": Includes legal documents that confirm the right to use, manage, and develop land for solar projects. This category is crucial for affirming legal authority over project sites and includes leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

        ""PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)"": Features contracts between the project developer and an off-taker regarding the sale of generated solar power, detailing prices, terms, and standards. No documents that contain amendments or additional information. 

        ""PPA Supplementary Documents"": Encompasses additional documents related to PPAs, such as amendments, technical specifications, applications, communications, Exhibits or Annexes, and O&M Agreements.

    3. Prioritize document essence and main purpose for classification. In cases of uncertainty or documents that span multiple categories, classify according to the document's primary focus.
