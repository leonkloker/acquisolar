        "Document_summary": "This document outlines a project focused on developing a machine learning model to compute the reactivity values of RNA molecules based on their sequences. By utilizing SHAPE data, the project aims to bridge the gap between RNA sequence and structure to enable the prediction of tertiary structure. Various models were deployed and evaluated, with the best performing model incorporating a BERT-style foundation model with a GRU prediction head.",
