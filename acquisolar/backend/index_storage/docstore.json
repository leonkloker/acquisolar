INTRODUCTION\n\nBy this Application, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (\"Hawaiian Electric\" or the\n\n'Company\") seeks approval, by May 4, 2015 or as soon as reasonably practicable, of a Power\n\nPurchase Agreement and other matters relating to a 45.9 megawatt (\"MW\") AC net photovoltaic\n\n(\"PV\") project proposed by Waiawa PV, LLC (\"WPV\" or \"Seller\"), which is to be located in\n\nWaiawa, on the island of O'ahu (the \"Project\").' Hawaiian Electric and WPV have executed a\n\nPower Purchase Agreement for Renewable As Available Energy, dated December 3, 2014, 2014\n\n(\"PPA\").\n\n1 This Project arises from Docket No. 2013-0381 in which the Hawai' i Public Utilities Commission\n\n(\"Commission\") granted waivers from the Framework for Competitive Bidding for six independent power producer\n\n(\"IPP\") solar energy projects on O'ahu (the \"Waiver II Projects\"). The Waiver II Projects are in addition to the\n\nthree IPP solar energy projects on O'ahu that the Commission also granted waivers from the Competitive Bidding\n\nFramework in Docket No. 2013-0156 (the \"Waiver I Projects\"). The Waiver I Projects and Waiver II Projects are\n\ncollectively referred to herein as the \"Waiver Projects\".\n\nHawaiian Electric respectfully submits that the Project and PPA should be\n\napproved because: (1) the Project is consistent with the Commission's Inclinations2 and the\n\nCompany's PSIP;3(2) the fixed PPA energy price is reasonable and is projected to fall below\n\nthe price of energy produced from petroleum diesel, low sulfur fuel oil (\"LSFO\") or other fuel\n\noil during the term of the PPA; (3) the Project is not expected to impact curtailment of existing\n\nas-available renewable resources or impede the consideration of additional renewable resources\n\nto Hawaiian Electric's system; (4) the Project will help to meet the State of Hawai'i's (the\n\n\"State\") energy policy objectives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (\"RPS\") law; and (5) the\n\nProject will contribute to the State's goal of greater energy security and energy self-sufficiency.\n\nTime is of the essence under the PPA, and WPV's ability to achieve\n\n\"Constructions Milestones\" is critically important.

PPA Approval\n\nCommission approval of this PPA, purchased energy charges, and payments made\n\nfor Compensable Curtailed Energy as described herein, is sought pursuant to HRS \u00a7 269-27.2\n\n6-\n\nand HAR Chapter 6-74, which generally guide the Commission's review of the rates agreed\n\nupon between Hawaiian Electric and WPV. Specifically, HRS \u00a7 269-27.2(c) provides, in\n\nrelevant part:\n\nThe rate payable by the public utility to the producer for the non-\n\nfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility shall\n\nbe as agreed between the public utility and the supplier and as\n\napproved by the public utilities commission; provided that in the\n\nevent the public utility and the supplier fail to reach an agreement\n\nfor a rate, the rate shall be as prescribed by the public utilities\n\ncommission according to the powers and procedures provided in\n\nthis chapter.\n\nThe commission's determination of the just and reasonable rate\n\nshall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that removes\n\nor significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil\n\nfuels and the rate for the non-fossil fuel generated electricity to\n\npotentially enable utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel\n\ncost savings resulting from the use of non-fossil fuel generated\n\nelectricity. As the commission deems appropriate, the just and\n\nreasonable rate for non-fossil fuel generated electricity supplied to\n\nthe public utility by the producer may include mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments, such as\n\nadjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or other\n\nacceptable adjustment mechanisms.\n\nHAR \u00a7 6-74-22(a) also provides that the rates for purchase shall:\n\n(1) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the\n\nelectric utility and in the public interest;\n\n(2) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small\n\npower production facilities; and\n\n(3) Be not less than one hundred per cent of avoided cost for\n\nenergy and capacity purchases to be determined as provided in [HAR \u00a7] 6-74-23 from qualiing facilities and not less than the minimum purchase rate.\n\n' Notwithstanding, HAR \u00a7 6-74-15(b)(1) states that nothing in HAR Title 6, Chapter 74, Subchapter 3 (i.e., HAR \u00a7\u00a7 6-74- 15 to 28) \"[p]rohibits an electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or\n\nterms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would\n\notherwise be required by this subchapter[.]\"\n\n7 -\n\n3.

The proposed solar farm would\n\nbe located on the portion of the TMK that is east of the freeway, within a contiguous area that is\n\nirregular in shape. Elevation of the project site ranges from approximately 720 feet above sea\n\n13 -\n\nlevel near the H-2 Freeway to approximately 940 feet at the east end of the site. The topography\n\nof the site is gently sloping, transitioning to steep gulches along the northern and southern edges\n\nof the property (Kipapa Gulch and Panakauahi Gulch, respectively). This area is comprised of\n\nformer agricultural fields that were previously cultivated with pineapple and sugarcane, and is\n\ncurrently used for cattle grazing; there are no structures within the project site. The State land\n\nuse classification is Agricultural and the City & County of Honolulu zoning designation is AG-1\n\n(Restricted Agriculture). Access to the site is provided by a private agricultural road with\n\ningress/egress off Ka Uka Boulevard (across from the Costco Waipio complex), there is no\n\npublic access to the site. The property is currently owned by Castle & Cooke Homes Hawaii,\n\nInc., and First Wind has an option to purchase the property, including rights to access the\n\nproperty via the Pineapple Road overpass. When completed, the area of the WPV project site\n\nwithin the perimeter fence will be approximately 313 acres.\n\n2. The Facilitv\n\nWPV will construct, own, and operate the proposed Facility in parallel with\n\nHawaiian Electric' s system.

Both the Akau Substation and line extension\n\nwill be constructed by the Company (see Exhibit 12 for the project location). As explained later\n\nin this Application, the interconnection work associated with the Facility will be managed by\n\nHawaiian Electric. The estimated capital cost for Hawaiian Electric's interconnection work is\n\napproximately $13.5 million which will be paid for by WPV.\n\nAs part of the interconnection, Hawaiian Electric proposes to construct 1) two\n\nsingle circuit deadend steel poles; 2) one single circuit tangent steel pole; 3) approximately 350\n\nfeet of 3-phase double-bundled 556 AAC overhead conductor; 4) approximately 350 feet of\n\n197.5 AAAC, 7/0 strands, \"Amherst\" shield wire; 5) new OPGW to be routed on two diverse\n\nroutes into the Akau Substation to be spliced with existing OPGW on the Kahe-Wahiawa\n\ntransmission line.\n\nIncluded with this PPA are a preliminary single-line diagram, relay list, relay\n\nsettings, and trip scheme of the Facility as Attachment E (Single-Line Drawing) and Attachment\n\nF (Relay List and Trip Scheme).

In\n\ncontrast to prior as-available renewable energy PPAs previously entered into by Hawaiian\n\nElectric and approved by the Commission, this PPA requires Hawaiian Electric to pay for certain\n\ncurtailed energy, or \"Compensable Curtailed Energy\" as defined in the PPA.\n\nEssentially, Hawaiian Electric will pay the same contract rate for both electric\n\nenergy delivered pursuant to the PPA and for Compensable Curtailed Energy. This pricing\n\nstructure for electric energy is sometimes referred to as \"RAP Pricing\" or \"Take or Pay Pricing\"\n\nherein. This concept is presented for Commission approval and has contributed to garnering the\n\nlowest proposed renewable energy contract prices from developers participating in the Waiver\n\nInvitation, as well as the lowest proposed renewable energy contract prices in Hawaiian\n\nElectric's history.\n\nHawaiian Electric has also negotiated with WPV to have the amount of\n\nCompensable Curtailed Energy paid for by Hawaiian Electric to be \"banked\"such that at the end\n\nof the Initial Term, Hawaiian Electric will have the option of extending the Term of the PPA for\n\na Banked Curtailed Energy Term. The contract rate for energy delivered during the Banked\n\n16 -\n\nCurtailed Energy Term is substantially less than the contract rate during the Initial Term, and\n\nWPV will not be paid for Compensable Curtailed Energy during the Banked Curtailed Energy\n\nTerm. The Banked Curtailed Energy Term will expire on the first to occur of (i) the last Day of\n\nthe calendar month during which the last of the Banked Curtailed Energy is delivered to\n\nHawaiian Electric or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the end of the Initial Term. The rationale for the\n\nlower contract rate during the Banked Curtailed Energy Term is that Hawaiian Electric has\n\nalready paid for the Banked Curtailed Energy and payments to Seller during the Banked\n\nCurtailed Energy Term should be for purposes of covering Seller's operating and maintenance\n\ncosts.\n\nHawaiian Electric's recovery for payments made to WPV for Compensable\n\nCurtailed Energy is reasonable because the contractual mechanism for such payments has\n\nreduced financing uncertainty for WPV and has thereby enabled an additional reduction in\n\nWPV' s proposed energy price.

Overall, the findings of the\n\nIRS showed that it is feasible to connect the WPV project to the Hawaiian Electric system. The\n\nLiedos report stated that an SEL311 L relay is planned for the 138 kV main lines at Akau and\n\nHema Substations. This relay will be the main source of protection to respond to a fault at the\n\nproject point of interconnection. Leidos recommended that Hawaiian Electric use a Zone 1\n\ninstantaneous response to detect and clear faults at both project sites.

Additional Interconnection Requirements Study\n\nDuring the course of the Hawaiian Electric's interconnection requirements\n\nstudies, an additional issue came to light which requires further study for all projects\n\ninterconnecting in the Wahiawa region. In normal operating conditions, the Wahiawa region is\n\nserved by a 138 kV transmission loop system. However, when any part of the Waiau-to-\n\nWahiawa 138 kV line or the Kahe-to-Wahiawa 138 kV line is out of service, the Wahiawa\n\nregion remains connected in a radial condition only. As a result, in a contingency event such as a\n\nfault that causes the outage of this remaining 138 kV radial connection (i.e., \"N-1-1\n\ncontingency\"), it is possible that the generation interconnecting to this line would be stranded\n\nwithin the Wahiawa region and could be temporarily islanded with a very high generation-to-\n\nload ratio until the generation is disconnected. The possible overvoltage impacts of this N-1- 1\n\n22 -\n\ncontingency are a significant concern that must be evaluated with detailed PSCAD analyses that\n\ncan precisely represent the behavior of multiple projects connected to the 138 kV transmission\n\nloop in the Wahiawa region at the same time (the \"Additional IRS\").\n\nThe Additional IRS has not yet been completed. However, because Hawaiian\n\nElectric did not want to delay completion of the PPAs, Hawaiian Electric and WPV have agreed\n\nto add an additional provision to the PPA in Section 29.26 (N-1-1 Contingency) addressing the\n\nAdditional IRS study. The new provision provides that if the Additional IRS finds there will be\n\novervoltage concerns with the N-1-1 contingency then mitigating measures may be implemented.\n\nIf an overvoltage concern exists and mitigating measures are not implemented then the Company\n\nanticipates having to curtail WPV's facility for significant durations through year 2020 while\n\nline upgrades are completed on the Waiau-to-Wahiawa 138 kV line and the Kahe-to-Wahiawa\n\n138 kV line.\n\nIn Section 29.26, Hawaiian Electric has agreed that if acceptable mitigating\n\nmeasures exist and if the Commission approves cost recovery for such mitigating measures then\n\nthe Company shall pay for and implement such measures.

Access to the project is by a private agricultural road with\n\ningress/egress off of Ka Uka Blvd (across from the Costco Waipio complex).\n\nHawaiian Electric reviewed the requirements set forth in HRS \u00a7269-27.6 to\n\ndetermine whether the138kV transmission line extensions should be constructed above or below\n\nthe surface of the ground. In making the determination to build the extensions of the Kahe-\n\nWahiawa l 38kV transmission line and OPGW overhead, Hawaiian Electric considered the\n\nfollowing:\n\n1. Whether a benefit exists that outweighs the costs of placing the electric\n\ntransmission svstem underground:\n\nInstalling the line extension of the Kahe-Wahiawa 138 kV transmission line\n\nunderground is estimated to cost approximately $ 1,026.866 more than the overhead alternative\n\nI (i.e.,$2,969,116 versus $1,942,250, not including removal costs). (See Exhibit 12 for the\n\nunderground and overhead lines capital cost estimates). The visual impact of extending the 138\n\nkV overhead lines will not significantly increase, as it will be located along the existing\n\nHawaiian Electric 138 kV overhead lines (Kahe-Wahiawa). The transmission line extension will\n\nalso be in an undeveloped area and not within a high-density population area. As a result, the\n\nvisual impact will not be significantly increased, and the benefits of undergrounding, if any, do\n\nnot outweigh the costs (see Attachment 2 for photos of the proposed line route).\n\nThe scope of the project is to extend Hawaiian Electric's existing Kahe-Wahiawa\n\n138kV for a loop in/out interconnection to the Akau substation. The transmission line extensions\n\nwill include two spans into the station, one approximately 169 feet long and the other\n\napproximately 170 feet long, and includes two (2) single circuit dead-end steel poles and one (1)\n\nsingle circuit tangent steel pole. The conductor system is composed of two sub-conductors\n\n(double bundled). The existing OPGW on the Kahe-Wahiawa transmission line will be spliced\n\n27-\n\nwith new OPGW to be routed on two diverse routes into the Akau Substation. The new segment\n\nof OPGW will be required for lightning protection into each of the substation dead-ends.\n\n2. Whether there is a governmental public policv reauiring the electric\n\ntransmission svstem to be placed. constructed. created. or built\n\nunderground. and the governmental agency establishing the Dolicv\n\ncommits funds for the additional costs of undergrounding:\n\nHawaiian Electric is not aware of any governmental public policy requiring the 138 kV\n\nline extensions to be constructed underground in the area.\n\n3.

The study provided an analysis comparing the electric and magnetic field (\"EMF')\n\nlevels of an overhead configuration and an underground configuration of the new transmission\n\nlines which are a connector tap to the existing Hawaiian Electric Kahe-Wahiawa circuit. The\n\nEMF modeling developed for this study shows that outside the site boundaries, there is no\n\nsignificant difference in the electric or magnetic fields between the overhead and the\n\nunderground configurations for the transmission tap lines. The magnetic field profiles for the\n\nunderground configuration are a bit narrower than for the overhead configuration but are at about\n\n31 -\n\nthe same peak field level. For the Waiawa Switchyard/Substation, the magnetic fields are\n\nessentially contained within the substation/switchyard fence except where the power lines go in\n\nand out. The November 2014 study containing CH2M Hill's subsequent findings are included as\n\nExhibit 12.\n\nFrom a distance to the nearest home of 1800 feet, the electric and magnetic fields\n\nwill essentially be zero for both sites for both the tap lines and the substation/switchyard. This is\n\nbecause the electric and magnetic fields decrease quickly with distance and in both cases they are\n\ninsignificant outside the solar farm site limits.\n\n9.

These\n\nsteps may include publishing a public notice of the filing of the Application and/or including\n\nnotification about the subject project on the Company's website.\n\nHawaiian Electric does not expect that there is a substantial desire on the part of\n\nthe community for undergrounding the line extensions of the Kahe-Wahiawa 138 kV circuit.\n\nThe public notices of the subject Application should help in determining the breadth and depth of\n\npublic sentiment with respect to an above-ground versus underground relocation for the subject\n\nproject.\n\n33 -\n\nXI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBased on the foregoing, Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the\n\nCommission:\n\n(a) Approve the PPA;\n\n(b) Find that the purchased energy charges to be paid by Hawaiian\n\nElectric pursuant to the PPA are just and reasonable;\n\n(c) Find that the purchased power arrangements under the PPA,\n\npursuant to which Hawaiian Electric purchases energy on an as-available basis from WPV, are\n\nprudent and in the public interest;\n\n(d) Authorize Hawaiian Electric to include the purchased energy\n\ncharges, the payments made for Compensable Curtailed Energy, and related revenue taxes that\n\nHawaiian Electric incurs under the PPA in and through Hawaiian Electric's ECAC to the extent\n\nsuch costs are not included in base rates;\n\n(e) Determine that the 138 kV line extensions that are included as part\n\nof Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities should be constructed above the surface of the\n\nground, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 269-27.6; and\n\n34-\n\n(f) Grant such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.\n\nDATED: Honolulu, Hawai'i, December 4, 2014.\n\nJose vicAE:Udent\n\nRegulatory Affairs\n\nHAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.\n\n35-\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nPAGE 1 OF 282\n\nEXECUTION VERSION\n\nHawaiian\n\nElectric\n\n2+2.", "start_char_idx": 61564, "end_char_idx": 65819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5988c68b-0e60-40ab-961f-5bde2f3d62de": {"__data__": {"id_": "5988c68b-0e60-40ab-961f-5bde2f3d62de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0193da92-5bc0-4237-a459-a36fcc5ab249", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "hash": "5a6b7b3a684ff776dc96501ab0a9e7b22b11f7215dc2ca3650789d21c2499b94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a03e752b-e309-4efa-8e85-4601eff39549", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "hash": "9dc54714e965a636e1fbfdfa8d6c82356d50c0342827aa7074fdb11dfbc93bfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7eccccdc-8495-4485-b72e-fed6f957ab2e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb0e53d9f9c7ed87da0036586caf3081543ddf800d2a8ab23381f6c4a3cadf0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "DATED: Honolulu, Hawai'i, December 4, 2014.\n\nJose vicAE:Udent\n\nRegulatory Affairs\n\nHAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.\n\n35-\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nPAGE 1 OF 282\n\nEXECUTION VERSION\n\nHawaiian\n\nElectric\n\n2+2.

However, when any part of the Waiau-to-Wahiawa\n\n138 kV line or the Kahe-to-Wahiawa 138 kV line is out of\n\nservice, the Wahiawa region remains connected in a\n\nradial condition only.

These tests may include the following:\n\nOn-site Tests:\n\n1. SCADA Test to verify the status and analog telemetry, and if\n\nthe remote controls between the Company's EMS and the\n\nFacility are working properly end-to-end.\n\n2. Curtailment Test to verify if the Facility curtailment\n\ncontrols and the Curtailment Control Interface with the\n\nCompany's EMS are working properly. The CSAT is generally\n\nconducted by setting different curtailment setpoints and\n\nobserving the proper curtailment and uncurtailment of the\n\nFacility's real power output.\n\n3. Voltage Regulation Control Test to verify the Facility can\n\nproperly perform automatic voltage regulation as defined in\n\nthis Agreement. Test is generally conducted by making small\n\nadjustments of the voltage setpoint and verifying by\n\nobservation that the Facility regulates the voltage at the\n\npoint of regulation to the setpoint.\n\n4. Frequency Regulation Control Test to verify the Facility\n\nprovides a frequency droop response as defined in this\n\nAgreement.\n\n[Test procedures will be based on frequency\n\ncontrol design.]\n\n5. Loss-of-Communication Test to verify the Facility will\n\nproperly shutdown upon the failure of the direct-transfer-\n\ntrip communication system.

As a\n\npart of the development of the Preferred Plan, system reliability analyses were performed to\n\nensure the reliability of the future electric system. Thus, the PSW identifies the resources needed\n\non the system in various years to meet reliability criteria.3 For example, the PSIP identified that\n\n200 MW of battery energy storage will be needed for contingency reserve by 2017. The request\n\nfor proposals for this resource is in progress.\n\nWith respect to this Project, WPV will be required to meet certain performance\n\nstandards to help ensure that the Project can interconnect and operate without compromising\n\nreliability. These performance standards are based on the IRS and included in the PPA.\n\n3 As stated by the Company in its response to Order No. 32264, the cost to implement reliability criteria are not specifically attributable to the WPV Project, as such measures are needed to address conditions that already exist.

Furthermore, the\n\nWaiver Invitation sought to capture the benefit of any and all tax incentives applicable to the\n\nprojects for customers, As such, the Waiver Invitation was designed for developers to include\n\nthe benefit of the Federal Investment Tax Credit in the proposed energy pricing, a major factor\n\nthat has directly impacted the development schedules of the participating projects. Because the\n\nHawai'i tax treatment that will apply to renewable energy technologies on the commercial\n\noperations date is uncenain, Hawaiian Electric has endeavored through the PPA negotiation\n\nprocess, including the negotiations process with WPV, to include provisions to reduce the\n\neffective PPA price, through a credit again WPV's invoice for electric energy, based on the\n\nbenefits from the Hawai'i state tax incentive/credit applicable to the project.

It is important that the portfolio evaluation process analyze and rank\n\nrenewable energy projects from a long-term public interest perspective in order to\n\nensure inclusion of more economically beneficial projects that may take longer time\n\nto develop, and might be otherwise foreclosed if the utility project development\n\nqueues are filled with only near-term projects. Selection of shorter lead-time\n\nrenewable projects could preclude development of alternative projects with greater\n\noverall ratepayer benefits, which results in a potential foregone economic benefit or\n\nan opportunity cost.\n\nThese potential opportunity costs need to be recognized explicitly in the evaluation process for as-available renewable resources. Likewise, with respect to the Initial and Second\n\nWaiver Applications, the commission is concerned that large quantities of relatively low\n\ncapacity factor PV generation could, at some level of development, have the unintended\n\nconsequence of potentially limiting the future amount of lower-cost, higher capacity factor\n\nrenewable energy resources that could be economically and reliably integrated on the O'ahu electric grid.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe WPV Project was included in the Company's PSIP, which evaluated various\n\nrenewable resources, such as wind, PV (both centralized and distributed), and biomass based on\n\nbenchmark pricing derived from published National Renewable Energy Laboratory studies. The\n\nCompany's analysis indicates that the addition of 269.5 MW of utility-scale PV, along with the\n\nanticipated addition of 400 MW of rooftop PV, will still allow additional \"headroom\" to add\n\nincrements of renewable generation, such as wind, with the deactivation of baseload units and\n\nreplacement with quick-start units.

Pricing\n\nThe pricing structure was determined through a competitive solicitation and a series of\n\narm's-length proposals and negotiations between Waiawa PV and Hawaiian Electric. Waiawa\n\nPV and Hawaiian Electric have negotiated a RAP structure with no escalation for the 22-year\n\ncontract term. For the purposes of this analysis, RAP pricing mechanism energy assumptions\n\nwere based on photovoltaic energy forecasts developed for Hawaiian Electric's Power Supply\n\nImprovement Plan.\n\n3. Pricing Evaluation\n\nThe pricing structure and pricing level were deemed reasonable by Hawaiian Electric\n\ntaking into consideration: (1) Hawaiian Electric's estimated long-run avoided costs over the 22-\n\nyear contract term for the Project; (2) the Company's December 2014 on-peak filed short-run\n\navoided energy cost rate of 15.758\u00a2 per kWh; (3) the levelized prices, with tax credits, for other\n\nrecently approved renewable energy projects on O'ahu. In addition, the energy pricing for the\n\nProject is consistent with the requirements of HRS \u00a7 269-27.2(c), as the energy price is not\n\nindexed to, and does not vary with changes in the price of fuel oil.\n\nA. Long-Run Avoided Cost Analysis\n\nHawaiian Electric's long-run avoided energy cost has served as a benchmark against\n\nwhich Independent Power Producer (\"IPP\") developers' proposed pricing are evaluated to assess\n\nthe reasonableness of the proposed pricing. Because the planning environment has become\n\nincreasingly uncertain, the determination of the utility's \"true\" avoided costs has become\n\n' Section 269-27.2(c) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes states in relevant part that \"The commission's\n\ndetermination of the just and reasonable rate shall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that\n\nremoves or significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels and the rate for the non-\n\nfossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost\n\nsavings resulting from the use of non-fossil fuel generated electricity.\"\n\nEXHIBIT 4\n\nPAGE 2 OF 17\n\nincreasingly complex. For example, the key determinants of avoided costs include, but are not\n\nlimited to, the forecast of future fossil fuel and biofuel prices; the forecast of sales and peak\n\ndemand; the size, type and characteristics of future firm capacity units installed to maintain\n\ngenerating system reliability; the size, type and characteristics of future as-available resources\n\ninstalled on the system; the amount of capacity installed under Net Energy Metering or Feed-In\n\nTariffs (\"FIT\"); and the amount of regulating reserve needed to maintain system stability. The\n\nassumptions for the production simulation model analysis herein are based on Hawaiian\n\nElectric's Power Supply Improvement Plan submitted on August 26,2014 in Docket No. 2011-\n\n0206.\n\nAs described in this Application, Waiawa PV was a participant in the Invitation and was\n\nselected by the Company for inclusion in its Waiver II Application filed in Docket No. 2013-\n\n0381. In order to evaluate the Waiawa PV Project's long-run avoided energy cost of energy,\n\nadditional pending utility-scale photovoltaic resources were considered in the base case analysis,\n\nincluding the other projects participating in Waiver II , the Mililani South Solar Park Project in\n\nDocket No. 2014-0077, and the Ka La Nui Solar Project in Docket No. 2014-0308. Because it is\n\nnot known at this time, when each of these pending projects will be placed into service, a proxy\n\nblock of future photovoltaic installations of 300 MW was used in the long run avoided cost\n\nanalysis for the Waiawa PV Project. By using a sample block of future PV installations with a\n\nsimilar commercial operations date as Waiawa PV, the implementation of pending PV projects\n\nis normalized, and the project specific impact to the avoided cost calculation are aggregated\n\nacross the block of projects. The benefits for each specific project can then be proportioned\n\nincrementally by project size over the entire block to assess the potential savings for each\n\nproject. For example if one project is 10 MW, the allocation of benefits will be 3% based on the\n\npercentage of the project size.

Variable Generation Renewable Resources\n\nVariable generation renewable resources such as wind and photovoltaic projects can have\n\na significant impact on avoided energy costs. Variable generating resources do not change the\n\nneed for firm resources since as-available resources cannot be relied upon to serve demand\n\nduring peak demand periods. The energy supplied by as-available resources provides energy to\n\nthe system and displaces fuel consumption, which may have an impact on the opportunity for\n\nother resources to displace energy. For the purpose of this analysis, the following as-available\n\nrenewable resources were included as a base case assumption, providing energy to the system:\n\ni. 99 MW Wind on O'ahu\n\nii. 11 MW Photovoltaic\n\niii. Feed-In-Tariff projects \u00b7\n\nThe difference in energy purchased from renewable as-available resources is included in\n\nthe avoided cost analysis.\n\nThe 11 MW of photovoltaic listed above includes IPPs that curre'ntly have PPAs with\n\nHawaiian Electric.\n\nb. Potential Transformation of the Hawaiian Electric System\n\nAs described in Chapter 5 of the PSIP, the Preferred Plan was developed to transform the\n\n0'ahu electrical system from its current state to a future vision of the utility.

Project Costs\n\nTo calculate the Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of the total payments to be made to the\n\nProject over the 22-year term of the PPA, the price of energy (in $ per MWh) in a particular year\n\nwas multiplied by the projected amount of energy (in MWh) to be purchased in that year. The\n\nprojected annual Risk Adjusted Price payments are provided in Attachment D, including both\n\npayments for energy delivered to the Company system and payments for Compensable Curtailed\n\nEnergy.. The total accumulated annual payments over the PPA term were then discounted using\n\nthe discount rate of 7.028% to 2014 dollars.\n\nii. Avoided Fuel Costs\n\nBy purchasing power from the Project, Hawaiian Electric will avoid burning fossil fuel in\n\nits generating units. The amount of fossil fuel Hawaiian Electric will avoid burning is calculated\n\nby a computer program that models how the generating units on the Hawaiian Electric system\n\nwill operate with and without the Waiawa PV Project on the system. The case with the PV\n\nblock, discussed above, is referred to as the Non-Utility Generator-in or \"NUG-in\" case; and the\n\ncase without the PV block is referred to as the \"NUG-out\" case. This methodology (referred to\n\nas the \"NUG-in/NUG-out\" method), calculates the difference in fuel consumption between the\n\ntwo cases, to determine the amount of fuel Hawaiian Electric will avoid consuming. The avoided fuel cost is established by identifying the amount of fuel avoided, multiplied by the\n\nprojected price per barrel of fuel in each project year. Year-by-year avoided fuel costs are shown\n\nin Attachment E. The avoided fuel costs are based on the modeled Waiawa PV energy that can\n\nbe integrated onto the system.\n\niii. Avoided Variable Operation and Maintenance Costs\n\nBy purchasing power from the Project or other PV projects, Hawaiian Electric will avoid\n\na portion of its variable operation and maintenance (\"0&M\") costs. The amount of variable\n\nO&M costs Hawaiian Electric will avoid is calculated by a computer program that models how\n\nthe generating units on the Hawaiian Electric system will operate with and without the PV block\n\non the system. The difference in variable O&M costs between the NUG- in/NUG-out cases\n\nestablishes the amount of variable O&M costs Hawaiian Electric will avoid. Hawaiian Electric' s\n\navoided variable O&M costs are shown in Attachment F. The avoided variable operation and\n\nConfidential Information Deleted\n\nEXHIBIT 4\n\nPursuant to Protective Order No.\n\nPAGE 6 OF 17\n\nmaintenance costs are based on the modeled Waiawa PV energy that can be integrated onto the\n\nsystem.\n\niv. Imputed Debt and Rebalancing Costs\n\nThe addition of the Project will result in impacts to Hawaiian Electric' s capital\n\nrequirements. The resulting imputed debt and rebaiancing costs are included in the calculations of the total avoided costs as shown in Attachment F.\n\nv. Total Long-Run Avoided Costs\n\nHawaiian Electric's total long-run avoided costs are the sum of the avoided fuel costs,\n\n0&M costs, and the difference in IPP payments. The annual accumulated NPV of total avoided costs over the 22- year term of the PPA including the imputed debt liability were discounted to 2014 dollars using the discount rate of 7.028%, as shown in Attachment G.

Imputed Debt and Rebalancing Costs\n\nThe addition of the Project will result in impacts to Hawaiian Electric' s capital\n\nrequirements. The resulting imputed debt and rebaiancing costs are included in the calculations of the total avoided costs as shown in Attachment F.\n\nv. Total Long-Run Avoided Costs\n\nHawaiian Electric's total long-run avoided costs are the sum of the avoided fuel costs,\n\n0&M costs, and the difference in IPP payments. The annual accumulated NPV of total avoided costs over the 22- year term of the PPA including the imputed debt liability were discounted to 2014 dollars using the discount rate of 7.028%, as shown in Attachment G. The total avoided\n\ncosts are based on the modeled Waiawa PV energy that can be integrated on the system\n\nvi. Comparison of Benefits and Costs\n\nThe customer benefit established by this analysis is shown through the fuel and variable\n\nO&M costs that Hawaiian Electric would avoid by purchasing energy from the Project, (i.e., the\n\nbenefits are Hawaiian Electric's total avoided costs less imputed debt).\n\nThe cost to Hawaiian Electric would be the RAP payments to be made to the Project and\n\nthe imputed debt liability. The accumulated NPV of the costs incurred by Hawaiian Electric\n\n(including payments made to the Project) under the PPA pricing over the 22-year term of the PPA, including the imputed debt liability, are compared to the NPV of the avoided costs in\n\nAttachment F.\n\nUsing the PSIP assumptions, the levelized pricing for the Project before the use of\n\nHawai'i state tax incentives, is about\n\nHawaiian Electric's long-run avoided costs,\n\nincluding imputed debt. It should be noted, however, that the projected long-term levelized\n\nenergy price against which Waiawa PV is evaluated is based on a current forecast of fossil fuel\n\nprices (LNG, Low Sulfur Fuel Oil and diesel fuel oil) and a successful transition from oil to LNG\n\nand other lower-cost renewables during the contract period, consistent with the PSIP. Actual\n\nfossil fuel prices and other resource costs may be higher or lower than currently forecast. If, for\n\nexample, actual fossil fuel prices are higher than currently forecast, the Company's projected\n\nlong-run avoided cost would be higher, thereby reducing the amount the Waiawa PV project is\n\nabove the long-run avoided cost. Additionally, Waiawa PV's energy price is fixed and the stable\n\npricing of the Waiawa PV project will contribute to the stabilization of overall energy pricing for\n\ncustomers. Furthermore, if Hawai'i state tax incentives are applied to the Waiawa PV price, the\n\nRisk Adjusted Price for Waiawa PV would be lower than the\n\nprice including\n\nimputed debt, which currently does not include the benefit of Hawai'i state tax incentives.\n\nTaking all these factors together, Hawaiian Electric believes that it is in the customers' best\n\ninterests to integrate the Waiawa PV Project onto the system to help achieve renewable energy\n\npolicy goals and long term price stability.\n\nConfidential Information Deleted\n\nEXHIBIT 4\n\nPursuant to Protective Order No.\n\nPAGE 7 OF 17\n\nVii.\n\nReasonableness Assessment\n\nThe Project's proposed levelized price including imputed debt, is\n\nbefore\n\nthe use of Hawai'i state tax incentives, which is about\n\nthan Hawaiian Electric's\n\nDecember 2014 filed short-run avoided energy cost rate.

As described in the Waiver Invitation and elsewhere in this Application, the primary reason that the Company's competitive Invitation was\n\nsuccessful in securing such low cost renewable energy projects as negotiated with Waiawa PV is\n\nthe limited opportunity to take advantage of the 30% Federal investment tax credit, which is\n\navailable in its present form until the end of 2016. The Invitation was structured to allow projects\n\nsuch as Waiawa PV to proceed quickly and take advantage of the Federal investment tax credit\n\nwhile it is still available for the benefit of the Company's customers. Due to the long\n\ndevelopment timeline required to execute utility scale renewable projects in Hawaii. it is a likely\n\npossibility that future renewable energy projects, in the near term, will not have access to such\n\nfavorable tax incentives as Waiawa PV, ultimately resulting in higher proposed energy rates\n\nfrom renewable project developers.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe pricing for the Project is reasonable considering that (a) over the 22- year contract\n\nterm, the NPV of payments to the Project are within the range of Hawaiian Electric's estimated\n\nlong-run avoided costs assuming LNG and other lower-cost resources are realized as assumed in\n\nthe PSIP (absent a successful transition from oil to LNG, the NPV of payments to the Project are\n\nnotably lower) ; (b) the PPA energy pricing is within the range of Hawaiian Electric's filed short-\n\nrun avoided energy cost rate over the past year and is measurably lower than Hawaiian Electric' s\n\ncurrent avoided energy costs; (c) the pricing structure meets the requirement of Hawaii Revised\n\nStatutes Section 269-27.2(c) in that there is no linkage between the energy price and Hawaiian\n\nElectric's cost of fossil fuels; (d) and the project will provide more renewable energy to the\n\nsystem. Taking all these factors together, Hawaiian Electric believes that it is in the customers'\n\nbest interests to integrate the Waiawa PV Project onto the system to help achieve renewable\n\nenergy policy goals and long term price stability.\n\nAttachment A\n\nAttachment B\n\nAttachment C\n\nAttachment D\n\nAttachment E\n\nAttachment F\n\nAttachment G\n\nAttachment H\n\nAttachment I\n\nEXHIBIT

The PPA contains indemnification, insurance,\n\nthird party evaluations and other provisions, including, provisions pertaining to the Term,\n\nWPV' s delivery of as-available renewable energy from the Facility, and WPV's compliance with\n\nlaws, which will serve to protect Hawaiian Electric and its customers from certain risks\n\nassociated with interconnecting the Facility to Hawaiian Electric's system. Moreover, the terms\n\nand conditions ofthe PPA will not affect Hawaiian Electric's ability to provide electric service to\n\nits customers and is not discriminatory to other small power producers. Hawaiian Electric\n\ncontends that, for these reasons, the purchased power arrangements (i.e., terms and conditions)\n\nunder the PPA, pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric purchases energy from WPV, are prudent\n\nand in the public interest. A summary of some ofthe key terms and conditions ofthe PPA is\n\nprovided below.\n\n1. Term\n\na. Initial Term. Banked Curtailed Energy Term and Extended Term. In\n\ngeneral, subject to Section 12.1 ofthe PPA, the Term ofthe PPA commences upon the Execution\n\nDate and remains in effect for an Initial Term of twenty-two (22) years following the\n\nCommercial Operations Date. The Initial Term is two (2) years longer than the term specified in\n\nthe Model PPA. This extended Initial Term provided the best pricing from developers and was\n\nuniformly adopted for all Waiver Projects.\n\nSubsequent to the Initial Term, pursuant to Section 12.10 of the PPA, the\n\nCompany may extend the Term of the PPA for a period (the \"Banked Curtailed Energy Term\"),\n\nEXHIBIT 6 \u00b7\n\nPAGE 1 OF 20\n\nnot to exceed five (5) years, that is necessary for atl Banked Curtailed Energy to be delivered to\n\nthe Company. The concept of this specific option to extend the Term is a new provision\n\ndeveloped to provide a benefit for the Compensable Curtailed Energy that, under the RAP\n\nPricing, will have been paid for but not delivered during the Initial Term. The Contract Price for\n\nenergy delivered during the Banked Curtailed Energy Term will be substantially less than the\n\nContract Price for the Initial Terml.

Enerev Pricing\n\nAs discussed above, energy payments by Hawaiian Electric to WPV were negotiated\n\nthrough a competitive process and based on a pricing structure and pricing level determined\n\nthrough a series of proposals and arms-length negotiations between the Parties. The pricing\n\nterms for the Project are covered in Attachment J (Energy Purchases by Company) of the PPA.\n\nSpecifically, Table J-1 (Contract Rate) of Attachment J (Energy Purchases by Company) sets\n\nforth the Contract Price for each year during the 22-year Initial Term.\n\na. Hawaii State Tax Credit Price Adiustment. The Contract Rate, however,\n\nis subject to adjustment according to Section 3 (Tax Credit Pass Through) of Attachment J\n\n(Energy Purchases by Company) of the PPA. According to this provision, WPV will return 90%\n\nof the applicable Mate tax incentive to the ratepayers by way of a credit against Hawaiian\n\nElectric's monthly energy payments. Hawaiian Electric and WPV will jointly choose an\n\nindependent expert to recommend by which available tax election WPV will maximize the credit\n\nagainst payments; the expert will also recommend whether or not to deal with a tax equity\n\ninvestor. If neither Party objects to the recommendation of the independent tax expert, WPV\n\nwill exert commercially reasonable efforts to successfully implement the expert' s\n\nrecommendation.8 WPV will be subject to liquidated damages if it fails to implement the agreed\n\nupon recommendation.

Due to the compressed time frames made necessary by this\n\nrequirement, WPV requested Hawaiian Electric to agree to meet certain milestones (the\n\n\"Company Milestones\") to provide WPV with assurance that it could meet the Commercial\n\nOperations Date in time to qualify for the ITC.19\n\nIn response, Hawaiian Electric agreed to certain threshold filing dates for this\n\nApplication, as described in Sub-section 1 (b) (Term) of this Exhibit 6 (Key PPA Terms and\n\nConditions).\n\nFurther, if WPV complete certain \"Seller's Conditions Precedent\" as set forth in\n\nAttachment K- 1 (Company Milestones and Seller's Conditions Precedent) ofthe PPA, Hawaiian\n\nElectric has agreed to further Company Milestones to commence the Acceptance Test and\n\ncomplete energization ofthe Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities by dates certain, as\n\ndescribed in Attachment K- 1 (Company Milestones and Seller's Conditions Precedent) of the\n\n17 See PPA \u00a712.10(C) (Sellers Option to \"Opt Out\" of Banked Cunailed Energy Term).", "start_char_idx": 676198, "end_char_idx": 680342, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6e1805c-2f04-4938-a85a-d5397a59bbbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6e1805c-2f04-4938-a85a-d5397a59bbbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0193da92-5bc0-4237-a459-a36fcc5ab249", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "hash": "5a6b7b3a684ff776dc96501ab0a9e7b22b11f7215dc2ca3650789d21c2499b94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5903e266-03ff-49c9-8600-526c73fcde93", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_name": "2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19542699, "creation_date": "2024-02-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-12", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-12", "filename": "data_structured/MegaSolar/PPA/2014-0359_PPA_on_p37.pdf"}, "hash": "160c59a538af8e3e335e6e430a6a82ba6fd69600baf8dee3efa3a0c8c5c8c1b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd9ae0fd-cbb6-47ba-8873-17e05d2ad77f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80c8d73f217131c30a18a68bd37cafd808c0cc8465e2c9057c5f1432314f1aa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Further, if WPV complete certain \"Seller's Conditions Precedent\" as set forth in\n\nAttachment K- 1 (Company Milestones and Seller's Conditions Precedent) ofthe PPA, Hawaiian\n\nElectric has agreed to further Company Milestones to commence the Acceptance Test and\n\ncomplete energization ofthe Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities by dates certain, as\n\ndescribed in Attachment K- 1 (Company Milestones and Seller's Conditions Precedent) of the\n\n17 See PPA \u00a712.10(C) (Sellers Option to \"Opt Out\" of Banked Cunailed Energy Term).\n\nM See PPA \u00a712.10(D) (Company's Purchase Option During Banked Curtailed Energy Term).

Curtailment Block\n\nWith the PPAs for the Waiver Projects, the Company has instituted a new\n\ncurtailment block concept. The curtailment block concept was intended to provide a mechanism\n\nfor multiple projects with anticipated commercial operation dates in close proximity, such as the\n\nwaiver projects selected under the Invitation (as defined in the Application), to be accommodated\n\nequitably within the existing reverse chronological seniority policy. By including all ofthe\n\nprojects selected as part o f the Waiver Invitations in the curtailment block, all participants are\n\nable to equally assess their risks related to curtailment seniority, which would have otherwise\n\nbeen out of their control under the previous PPA provisions that correlate curtailment seniority\n\nwith the date ofthe Commission's non-appealable PPA approval.\n\nThe specific block curtailment mechanisms are set forth in Section 2(e)(iii) of\n\nAttachment B (Facility Owned by Seller) of the PPA. All projects within the curtailment block\n\nwill have the same curtailment seniority date and curtailment will be shared proportionally for all\n\nprojects within the block. The block curtailment procedures are set forth in Attachment T\n\n(Block Curtailment Procedures) to the PPA. Attachment T to the PPA provides an explanation\n\nwith illustrative examples of how curtailment would occur under the block mechanism. In order\n\nto qualify for the block, a particular project's guaranteed commercial operations date, and\n\nachievement of the commercial operations date must both occur on or before the latter of\n\n20\n\nId.\n\nEXHIBIT 6\n\nPAGE 13 OF 20\n\neighteen (18) months following the Effective Date of such project' s PPA, or December 31,2016\n\n(the \"Qualitying Deadline\").

Meters\n\nPursuant to Section 10.1 of the PPA, Hawaiian Electric will purchase, own, install\n\nand maintain a Revenue Metering Package suitable for measuring the export of electric energy\n\nfrom the Facility sold to the Company. The metering point will be as close as possible to the\n\nPoint of Interconnection as allowed by the Company. WPV must make available a mutually\n\nagreeable location for the Revenue Metering Package, and must instalI, own and maintain the\n\ninfrastructure associated with the Revenue Metering Package.\n\nSection 10.1 of the PPA also provides that \"Company shall test such revenue\n\nmeter prior to installation and shall test such revenue meter every fifth (5% year [emphasis\n\nadded]. Seller shall reimburse Company for all reasonably incurred costs for the procurement,\n\ninstallation, maintenance and testing work associated with the Revenue Metering Package.\n\nHawaiian Electric acknowledges that the Commission, in two separate dockets seeking approval\n\nof PPAs, required annual meter testing, consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies\"4\n\nFeed-in Tariff (\"FIT\") Tier 3 PPA proposal that was filed in the FIT docket (Docket No, 2008-\n\n0273).25\n\nHawaiian Electric recognizes that the five-year term for meter testing in the PPA\n\nrepresents a departure from equivalent provisions in prior PPAs, including the FIT Tier 3 PPA.\n\nHowever, Hawaiian Electric respectfully submits that the departure is just and reasonable, and in\n\nthe public interest for several reasons.\n\nFirst, from a technical standpoint, because the Company has moved from\n\nmechanical meters to electronic meters, yearly testing of meters for projects of the size of the\n\nProject is unnecessary and impractical. The Company has found that the new electronic meters\n\nhave shown to be highly accurate and reliable, and are not prone to degrade like mechanical\n\nmeters. In fact, in the Company's experience, electronic meters have had an essentially 100%\n\npass rate on testing.\n\nSecond, annual meter testing for this Project is simply not cost-effective. This\n\nProject is 45.9 MW compared to the size of other existing IPP projects (e.g., Kalaeloa (208\n\nMW), AES (180 MW), and HPower (73 MW)). Given the relatively lower volume of kilowatt-\n\nhours being measured by the meter for this Project, it is reasonable, from a cost-benefit\n\nperspective, to require less frequent meter testing.

The estimated cost for the underground alternative is $ 2,969,116. The underground route essentially follows the same route as the overhead route, along a private parcel of land west of Interstate H-2. Please notify Hawaiian Electric by November 28, 2014, if First Wind is willing to pay for the costs of undergrounding the subject lines.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Each solar farm will require an interconnection to the electrical grid by\n\nconnecting to an existing Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO) 138 kilovolt (kV)\n\ntransmission line. The connection to each existing transmission line will be made via a new\n\nconnector tap line and substation/switchyard.\n\nThe Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) requires an analysis that compares the\n\nelectric and magnetic field (EMF) levels of an overhead (OH) configuration and an\n\nunderground (UG) configuration of new 138 kV transmission lines. Since the only\n\ntransmission lines that are new for these two projects are the connector tap lines that link the\n\nexisting transmission lines to the new substation/switchyards, those are the lines that were\n\nmodeled. The tap lines were modeled in both an overhead and an underground configuration.\n\nIn addition, each project requires the construction of new substations and switchyards to\n\nconnect each solar farm to the electric grid. These too were modeled.\n\nThis report describes the modeling of EMF and audible noise produced from corona for the\n\nproposed connecting tap lines to the existing]38 kV transmission lines for both projects. The\n\nreport also describes three dimensional magnetic field modeling results for the\n\nsubstation/switchyard for the Waiawa Solar Farm Project, which is the larger of the two\n\nprojects. The modeling results for Waiawa will also conservatively represent those fields that\n\nwould be modeled from the smaller Mililani Substation/Switchyard.\n\nConfiguration of Project\n\nThe proposed Waiawa Solar Farm project is a 47 MW project located on Oahu's central plain\n\njust east of Mililani town. The proposed substation/switchyard would be located adjacent to\n\nHECO's existing Kahe-Wahiawa 138 kV transmission line, which traverses the site. The\n\nproject will consist of a First Wind substation that takes the 34.5 kV electric power from the\n\nsolar farm and converts it to 138 kV transmission voltage. The 138 kV power is then sent to\n\nan adjacent HECO switchyard where a connection is made to the HECO transmission system\n\nvia a transmission tap line. The interconnecting 138 kV transmission tap line connecting the\n\nsubstation/switchyard to the transmission line would be approximately 166 feet long.

In the\n\nlamp example, if the lamp is turned on allowing electricity to ftow to the lamp, a magnetic field is created around the lamp cord in addition to the electric field. Magnetic fields are produced by both underground and overhead lines.\n\n4\n\nEXHIBIT 12\n\nPAGE 36 OF 64\n\nModeling Methodology\n\nThe overhead tap lines of the Mililani and Waiawa Solar Farm Projects were modeled for their resulting electric and magnetic fields using EMF Workstation: ENVIRO (Version 3.52), a Windows-based model developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). It is a\n\nprogram that accurately predicts the electric and magnetic fields produced by linear\n\ntransmission lines such as those in the Militani and Waiawa Solar Farm Projects.\n\nThe underground lines of the Mililani and Waiawa Solar Farm Projects were modeled for their resulting electric and magnetic fields using FIELDS 2.0 program, a DOS-based model\n\ndeveloped by Southern California Edison. This model was used since the ENVIRO model is\n\nnot capable of analyzing underground lines.\n\nThe nearest residences for the Mililani project are located approximately 490 feet northeast\n\nof the overhead tap line. For Waiawa, the nearest residence is located approximately 1800\n\nfeet to the east. As a result, both overhead tap lines were modeled at the lowest height of the\n\nconductors at mid span with ENVIRO as a conservative representation of the OH\n\nconfiguration. For the UG configuration, the tap lines were modeled with the conductors\n\nrunning in a single trench from the turning poles directly into the substation/switchyard.\n\nTo perform this modeling, detailed information was received from First Wind on the design\n\nof each of these tap lines and substation/switchyards, which included projected electrical power flows, operating voltage, tower configuration, conductor size and type, the height and horizontal location of each conductor, conductor sag, and conductor phasing. The modeling\n\nwas conducted with the power flow on each side of the tap line representing peak power flow.\n\nThe installation of the tap lines requires HECO to cut their existing transmission line and\n\nconnect a tap line to each side (Figure 2). The tap line is routed into one side of the\n\nsubstation/switchyard and then out the other side of the substation/switchyard forming an\n\nelectrical loop. In this way the electric current that once was flowing straight along the\n\nexisting HECO 138 kV transmission line now loops through the substation/switchyard. We\n\nestimated this power flow in the existing HECO transmission line to be 140 MW resulting in\n\n586 amperes of current. On one side of the tap line the existing power flow of 586 amperes flows from the HECO transmission line into the substation/switchyard. There the current\n\nfrom the solar farm (47 MW or 196 amperes at Waiawa and 35 MW or 146 amperes at\n\nMililani) is added resulting in a total return current of 782 amperes (Mililani) or 732 amperes\n\n(Waiawa) flowing out the other side of the tap line. These currents were modeled for the tap\n\nlines for both Mililani and Waiawa for both the overhead and underground configurations.\n\nThese data were input into both the ENVIRO and FIELDS programs which produced the\n\nlateral profiles of the electric and magnetic fields for each tap line.

The two tap lines were modeled only for the OH configuration\n\nsince no corona noise is produced by underground lines. Corona typically becomes a design concern for transmission lines at 345 kV and above and is less noticeable from lines like\n\nthese that are operated at lower voltages.\n\nThe electric field gradient is greatest at the surface of the conductor. Large-diameter conductors have lower electric field gradients at the conductor surface and, hence, lower corona than smaller conductors, everything else being equal. The conductors chosen for the Mililani and Waiawa Solar Farm Projects' transmission tap lines were selected to have large\n\ndiameters and thus a reduced potential to create audible noise.\n\n11\n\nEXHIBIT 12\n\nPAGE 43 OF 64\n\n1rregularities (such as nicks and scrapes on the conductor surface or sharp edges on\n\nsuspension hardware) concentrate the electric field at these locations and thus increase the\n\nelectric field gradient and the resulting corona at these spots. Similarly, foreign objects on the\n\nconductor surface, such as dust, sea salt crystals or insects, can cause irregularities on the\n\nsurface that are a source for corona.\n\nCorona also increases at higher elevations where the density of the atmosphere is less than at\n\nsea level. Audible noise will vary with elevation with the relationship of A/300 where A is\n\nthe elevation of the line above sea level measured in meters (EPRI 2005). Audible noise at\n\n600 meters elevation will be twice the audible noise at 300 meters, all other things being\n\nequal. The Mililani and Waiawa Solar Farm Projects' transmission lines were modeled with\n\nan elevation of 510 feet and 890 feet, respectively.\n\nRaindrops, fog, and condensation accumulated on the conductor surface are also sources of\n\nsurface irregularities that can increase corona. During fair weather, the number of these\n\ncondensed water droplets is usually small and the corona effect is also small. However,\n\nduring wet weather, the number of these sources increases (for instance due to rain drops\n\nstanding on the conductor) and corona effects are therefore greater. During wet or foul\n\nweather conditions, the conductor will produce the greatest amount of corona noise. However, during heavy rain the noise generated by the falling rain drops hitting the ground will typically be greater than the noise generated by corona and thus will mask the audible noise from the transmission line.\n\nCorona produced on a transmission line can be reduced by the design of the transmission line\n\nand the selection of hardware and conductors used for the construction of the line. For\n\ninstance the use of conductor hangers that have rounded rather than sharp edges and no\n\nprotruding bolts with sharp edges will reduce corona. The conductors themselves can be made with larger diameters and handled so that they have smooth surfaces without nicks or\n\nbum or scrapes in the conductor strands. The transmission lines proposed here are designed\n\nto reduce corona generation.\n\nModeling Methodology\n\nThe audible noise from the proposed transmission lines was predicted using EMF\n\nWorkstation: ENVIRO (Version 3.52), a Windows-based model developed by the Electric Power Research Institute\u00b7(EPRD.\n\nThe data presented in Appendix C were input into the ENVIRO program to calculate the corona audible noise, with the addition of elevation of the line above sea level. The project\n\ntransmission tap lines for Mililani and Waiawa were modeled with an elevation of 510 feet\n\nand 890 feet, respectively.

The Waiawa Substation/Switchyard was chosen since it will have a higher current\n\nflow compared to the Mililani Substation/Switchyard.

The magnetic fields that\n\nwill be generated by the proposed substation/switchyard expansions were calculated using the Grid\n\nmode in 3D-FIELDS at an elevation of three feet above the ground within the substation/switchyard.\n\nThe accuracy of the modeling is dependent on the accuracy of the input data (i.e., i f the average phase\n\ncurrent is higher than what was modeled, so will the resulting magnetic fields). The resulting field\n\nplots are within a few percent of the true value for the conditions modeled.\n\nThe 3-D magnetic field analysis was conducted with 586 ampere current flow from the existing\n\nHECO transmission line, 196 amperes from the solarfann and 782 amperes combined current\n\nreturned to the HECO transmission line. This represents the maximum expected current flow in each\n\nof the buss conductors to depict the highest possible magnetic fields that would be produced by the\n\nWaiawa Substation/Switchyard. The entering and exiting transmission tap lines in the analyses of the\n\nsubstation/switchyards were modeled at 586 and 782 amperes, the same current flow that was\n\nmodeled in the separate Waiawa transmission tap line analyses discussed above.\n\nThe transformers and other items of discrete electrical equipment in the substation/switchyard were\n\nnot modeled since they comprise point sources of magnetic fields which will have a very rapid \"cube\n\nof the distance\" decay. For example if a magnetic field of 100 mG is predicted at five feet from a\n\ntransformer the field level becomes approximately one eighth of this or 12.5 mG at twice the distance (ten feet) and 1.6 mG at 20 feet.\n\nThe gridded magnetic field values from the buss and transmission tap line conductors computed by 3D-F[ELDS are then plotted using the 3-D graphing program Surfer available from Golden Software.\n\nSurfer creates a two-dimensional contour line representation of the magnetic field levels across the\n\nsubstation/switchyard.\n\nThe magnetic fields that will be generated by the proposed Waiawa Substation/Switchyard were\n\nplotted as shown in Figure 12. The contour lines shown in the white and blue colors are the locations\n\nwhere the magnetic field is the highest and the lowest levels shown in green are approaching zero mG\n\nfield strength.\n\nThe figure shows that the magnetic field strength decreases to background levels at the new\n\nsubstation/switchyard fence on the northwest. and southeast sides of the new substation/switchyard.\n\nThe fields are elevated at the fence where the transmission lines enter the new substation/switchyard\n\nyard from the west and the 34.5 kV lines that go to the solar farm to the northeast. Those fields where\n\nthe transmission lines enter the new substation/switchyard yard are about 125 mG; however, those\n\ntransmission lines are within the First Wind easements.

The magnetic field profiles for the underground configuration are a bit narrower than for the overhead configuration but are at\n\nabout the same peak field level. For the Waiawa Switchyard/Substation, the magnetic fields are essentially contained within the substation/switchyard fence except where the power lines\n\ngo in and out.\n\nAt the distance to the nearest homes the electric and magnetic fields will essentially be zero for both sites for both the tap lines (490 feet at Mililani and 1800 feet at Waiawa) and the\n\nsubstation/switchyard (275 feet at Mililani and 1800 feet at Waiawa). This is because the\n\nelectric and magnetic fields decrease quickly with distance and in both cases they are\n\ninsignificant outside the solar farm site limits.\n\nThe corona noise produced by the overhead configurations at both locations are very similar, with a maximum noise level beneath the tap line of 15 dBA in wet weather and 0 in dry weather. At the nearest house for both the Mililani and the Waiawa substation/switchyard tap\n\nlines the level of noise will be 0 dBCA) or very close to 0 dB(A)for both wet and dry conditions (2.3 dBCA) at the nearest residence to the Militani substation/switchyard tap line).\n\n1\u00a7\n\n.\n\n--\n\nEXHIBIT 12 -\n\nPAGE 48 OF 64\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nOH and UG Configurations\n\ne...2\n\nDETAIL O 9% LIST\n\nTal- R,/'cO\n\n1 (\n\nCltr'*f )\n\n' ..... ./1............'ll -C.i-\n\n11 ///4 /01 \u00b7 /)/114/-//.t\u00b7UD\u2022\n\n12 4 2 \u20ac10- Cal C- 9/- C-KI\n\nI -- -=*....m- -=-\n\nm =-rEI,a -O,1\n\nn m CARD<ks-/2-\u20221 1/7\n\n1. -- -ac.

Testina for Gas Leaks: Arellano asked and Chung noted that BWS continues to monitor the water in the Red Hill area. Arellano noted that she did not know that there was an underground electric train from Red Hill to Pearl Harbor.\n\nHonolulu Rail Proiect: Scott Ishikawa reported the following:\n\nFour-Car Configuration: The Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation CHART) recently approved moving to a four-car configuration for the trains. HART had originally planned to open the system with a two-car train configuration, eventually increasing to four-car configurations. The four car trains will carry up to 800 passengers and have about 200 seats. Passengers, particulady those with disabilities or parents with strollers and small children who need more time to board and exit, will have more entry and exit points and an easier time boarding trains. HART will also see a cost savings in operations and maintenance costs.\n\nStations and Platforms: Stations and platforms are already designed to accommodate four-car trains. The added benefits to customers and cost savings prompted the decision to go directly to a four-car configuration beginning opening day of rail service. Other incentives, including the 25 percent increase in seating and free Wi-Fi on trains, are also expected to boost ridership.\n\nConstruction: It's been about four months since construction resumed on the Honolulu rail project. Nearly\n\nforty of the columns that will be built to support the elevated guideway have now been completed. Work on more of the column foundations continues in Ewa. In addition, soil testing, utility relocation and demolition\n\nis underway at several other locations all along the twenty mile rail route to Kakaako.\n\nSafetv: As safety is a main priority for HART, motorists are advised to use caution when entering a\n\nconstruction zone, observe posted signs for detours and construction activity and keep a safe distance from workers and equipment. Motorists should anticipate some possible delays in traffic and proceed with caution through the work areas.\n\nInformation: For more information, please visit the website .www, honolulutransit.org, call the project hotline\n\nat 566-2299 or email a question at info@honolulutransit.org.\n\nRail Station Desion Community Inforrnational Meetina #2: The meeting will be held on Wednesday,\n\nJanuary 29, 2014, Highlands Intermediate School Cafeteria; 6:00 p.m., registration and open house, 6:30 p.m. program begins, and 8:30 p.m. meeting ends.\n\nQuestions, comments and concerns:\n\n1. Blocking of Lanes: Dau noted the blocking of lanes to install the columns. Ishikawa replied that blocking of\n\nlanes is occurring in the Aiea/Pearl City areas. Test shock work is happening. Test columns are being built to determine the foundation depths. Dau asked if lanes would be blocked for the next five (5) years.\n\n2. HECO Power Plant: Dau asked and Ishikawa noted that equipment is being dismantled by HECO. Dau\n\nreiterated the lanes are closed off in the HECO section of the highway. Ishikawa added that when drill work is being done is when the lanes are pushed out.\n\nEXHIBIT 12\n\nPAGE 58 OF 64\n\nMILILANI/WAIPIO/MELEMANU NEIGHBORHOOD BOARD NO. 25\n\nWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 2014\n\nDRAFT-REGULAR MEETING MINUTES\n\nPAGE 4 OF 8\n\nOther Communitv Concerns: None.\n\nRecognition Awards:\n\nCouncilmember Ron Menor: Councilmember Ron Menor was presented with a lei and certificate of\n\nrecognition for truly representing the community's interest in recent deliberations granting county zoning for\n\nthe Koa Ridge development.

Variable descriptions are provided in a separate document.1 Make sure you understand the nature of the loans (see the SBA website for more details on the loan program, which is called \u201c504\u201d), the structure of the data set and the variables provided. Detailed instructions follow.\n\nClean the data set (eg remove loans labeled Exempt and Canceled, identify bad values). NB: loans which have a CHGOFF status but a gross charge-off amount of zero should not be dropped (treat these as defaults; the SBA probably made a full recovery due to selling collateral).\n\nThink about the treatment of missing data (for example, the InitialInterestRate is missing for many loans in the sample). One approach is to introduce dummy variables for missingness (as discussed in class).\n\nThink about the construction of training, validation and testing sets (eg. Random splitting vs. splitting by calendar date)\n\nExplore the loan data set to inform model building. \u2022 Justify your model of default timing and the choice of predictor variables. Explore predictor variables beyond those provided in the SBA data set, in particular time-varying risk factors at the regional (i.e. zip-code) level. Also consider linear and nonlinear model alternatives.\n\nSelect and implement an appropriate method for fitting the model parameters. \u2022 Rigorously test predictive performance (in- and out-of-sample) of your model alternatives using a Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve or other appropriate metrics. \u2022 Explain the fitting results and the fitted model. Which variables are important and why? \u2022 Next develop, fit, and evaluate a model for the loss at default (constructed in addition to the model of default timing).\n\nThen, estimate the distribution of total loss on a portfolio of 1,000 loans randomly selected from the test set, over five and ten year periods.\n\no Think of this as a hypothetical portfolio that is to be evaluated as of the current date. Use the time-independent loan/borrower attributes (eg. Loan term) from these loans along with current values of the macro-economic and any other time- varying variables (if you use any) when evaluating your fitted model.\n\nMeasure the risk in terms of the VaR and the Average VaR (also known as expected shortfall) at the 95% and 99% levels. Include confidence bands for your estimates. \u2022 Finally, estimate the distributions for the five and ten year losses of an investor who has bought a [5%,15%] tranche backed by the chosen portfolio. Also consider a [15%, 100%] senior tranche. Interpret and compare the distributions from a risk management perspective.\n\n1 It appears that the description in the variables PDF is wrong for ChargeOffDate. It contains the description for GrossChargeOffAmount, we believe.\n\no Owning a [x%, y%] tranche means that the first x% of losses due to default in the portfolio can occur before the investor in this tranche experiences losses, and any following losses affect this tranche entirely until losses in the portfolio reach y% (at which point the investor is \u201cwiped out\u201d: the entire investment is written off). So e.g. a 10% realized loss rate on the portfolio is a 33% loss for the [5%, 15%] tranche, a 15% rate is 100% loss for the tranche, etc.\n\nWrite up a final report, detailing your models, statistical estimation approaches, tests, and results. We\u2019d like to see sufficient details enabling us to replicate the results.\n\nPlease form a team of up to 4 students by Tuesday 1/16/24 10PM and send an email with the team composition (including names and email addresses) to the TA (one email per team).\n\nThe teams will present their results in the last class on 3/15/24.
