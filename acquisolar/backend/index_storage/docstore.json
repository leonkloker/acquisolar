Developer proposes to develop the Project on approximately 375 acres of land (the \"Project Site\") located in Maui County, Hawai'~ being a portion of the 1,354 acres of land comprising a portion of Tax Map Key No. (2) 2-2-002- 084 (Parcel B), outlined in red on Exhibit A attached hereto (collectively, the \"Property\"). The conceptual layout for the proposed Project is shown on Exhibit B attached hereto. Owner and Developer are sometimes referred to herein as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"\n\nAgreement to Lease and Ground Lease. Owner and Developer shall negotiate in good faith the terms and provisions of (a) an Agreement to Lease (the \"Agreement to Lease\"), (b) Ground Lease that will be granted by Owner at the closing under the Agreement to Lease permitting Developer to use the Project Site for the Project, subject to certain reservations in favor of Owner, and (c) such non-exclusive access easements over lands owned by Owner as necessary for Developer or Developer's contractors to access the Property during the Project's construction and operations, provided such access easements do not create any material liability, obligation or cost for Owner or a material adverse impact on Owner's use or intended use of the burdened lands (\"Easements\"). The Agreement to Lease, Ground Lease, and any such Easements are collectively referred to herein as the \"Project Documents\". The Project Documents shall include the general terms described on the term sheet attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated by referenced herein (the \"Term Sheet\"), and shall also contain such other reasonable terms and provisions as the Parties agree. Owner and Developer shall further negotiate in good faith the terms and provisions of any non-exclusive easement over lands owned by Owner located outside the Project Site and required for the operation of the Project and interconnection to the transmission lines servicing the Project. It will not be deemed unreasonable for Owner to refuse to grant easements that create any material liability, obligation or cost for Owner or a material adverse impact on Owner's use or intended use of the burdened lands. The Parties recognize that successful negotiation of the Agreement to Lease and Ground Lease require substantial definition and refinement of the concepts expressed in this Letter of Intent and final mutual agreement on all terms and conditions set forth in the Term Sheet. The execution of the Agreement to\n\n1.\n\n1\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nLease and any non-exclusive easement shall be conditioned upon, among other things, MECO including Developer's Project on the \"Priority List\" (as defined in the RFP) pursuant to the RFP. The execution of the Ground Lease shall be conditioned upon, among other things, Developer's Project being selected as part of the \"Final Award Group\" (as defmed in the RFP) pursuantto the RFP, and Developer subsequently entering into a power purchase agreement (\"PPA\") with MECO pursuant to the RFP and the PUC approval of such PPA.\n\n2.\n\nSigning Fee.\n\nNon-Exclusive.
