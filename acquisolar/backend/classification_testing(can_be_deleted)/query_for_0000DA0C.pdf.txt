11. DESCRIPTION OF SELLER.
Seller is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered to do business in Hawaii, is a developer of renewable energy systems, and has its principal place of business located at 300 Spectrum Center Dr., Suite. 1020, Irvine, California 92618. Seller was organized for the purposes of developing, financing, constructing, owning, and operating the Project. Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller will hire a licensed contractor to construct the Project and will own and operate the Project in parallel with the Utility's system according to the terms of the PPA.
As further background, Seller is directly owned by FCHQC Development, LLC, which was created by a joint venture between Hanwha Energy USA Holdings Corporation d/b/a 174 Power Global (formerly 174 Power Global Corporation) ("174 PG") and Forest City Sustainable Resources, LLC ("Forest City"). 174 PG is the current majority owner and Managing Memberof Seller and is in the process of increasing its ownership in Seller to 100%. The ownership structure of Seller is attached as Exhibit A-2 to the PPA. Seller is in good standing with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii; a copy of Seller's Certificate of Good Standing is attached as Exhibit A-1 to Attachment A of the PPA.
With respect to experience in Hawaii, Forest City has developed six small utility scale Feed-in-Tariff projects on Oahu. To pursue this larger project, Forest City subsequently entered into a partnership with 174 PG, which had recently developed the larger (5MWac) Kalaeloa Renewable Energy Project under a current PPA contract with HECO. Seller also participated in the HECO's prior "waiver projects" solicitation in 2014-
2015 for a project at the same Project site and this earlier effort well-positions Seller to advance this current Project.
(00495561.} 4
174 PG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hanwha Energy Corporation and part of the Hanwha Group of companies. Affiliated companies under the Hanwha Group include Hanwha Q CELLS Co. ("Hanwha Q CELLS"), listed on the NASDAQ, and Hanwha Q CELLS USA Corp. Hanwha Corporation, the parent corporation of the Hanwha Group, was ranked 331 St, 32gth, 27711,246th and 244th on the Fortune Global 500 List in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In 2017, Hanwha Group listed revenues of about $41 billion, assets of $128 billion, and equity of $37 billion. Moreover, the Hanwha Group has installed over 35 utility-scale projects worldwide, totaling more than 600 MW in North America and over 1 gigawatt ("GW") globally.
174 PG is responsible for Hanwha Group's solar development activities in the Americas. While 174 PG operates independently from its parent and sister companies, it has access to all the resources, expertise, and experience of the Hanwha Group. For example, Hanwha Q CELLS is now one of the largest worldwide manufacturers of solar photovoltaic cells with a capacity of 8.0 GW per year. With such diversity, the Hanwha Group can provide a fully vertically integrated approach to projects, incorporating module manufacturing, global supply and distribution, extensive utility scale project development experience, and in-house independent power producer asset finance and ownership. The Hanwha Group also maintains the financial capacity to finance all projects internally for long-term asset ownership - and additionally maintains strong financial partnerships with banks and tax equity providers as necessary to maximize project value. For Seller, this enables 174 PG to assemble all critical project delivery requirements within a single high-
credit large-cap corporate environment.

(1) A clear and concise statement of the direct and substantial interest of the applicant;
(2) The applicant's position regarding the matter in controversy;
(3) The extent to which the participation will not broaden the issues or delay the proceeding;
(4) The extent to which the applicant's interest will not be represented by existing parties;
(5) A statement of the expertise, knowledge or experience the applicant possesses with regard to the matter in controversy;

Seller has a direct and substantial interest in the outcome of this proceeding. As mentioned above, Seller will develop and own the Project and operate it in parallel with the Utility's system according to the terms of the PPA. Seller is the seller under the PPA and is responsible for obtaining the governmental approvals and land rights necessary for the construction and operation of the Project pursuant to the terms of the PPA. To-
date Seller has invested significant time, effort, and resources to develop this Project and 6 HAR § 16-601-56(b)-(c) {00495561.} 6
negotiate the PPA with the Utility, subject to the Commission's approval. The outcome of this proceeding will significantly impact Seller's finances, assets, and operations because the Commission's approval of the PPA, including all of the Requested Approvals, are necessary to allow the Project to move forward and for Seller's investment to be realized. Thus, Seller has a substantial interest in the outcome of this proceeding.
B. The Applicant's Position Regarding the Matter in Controversy.
Seller supports the approval of the Application. Seller respectfully requests that the Commission find that the Utility has met its burden of proof in support of its requests for approval of the PPA and all of the Requested Approvals.
C. The Extent to Which the Participation Will Not Broaden the Issues or Delay the Proceeding.
Seller's participation will not broaden the issues or delay the proceeding. Per Section 12.3(b) of the PPA, the scope of Seller's participation shall be determined by the PUC, however, Seller agreed to "seek participation for the limited purpose and only to the extent necessary to assist the PUC in making an informed decision regarding the approval of this Agreement."7 Thus, Seller's proposed participation is intended to assist the Commission in making an informed decision regarding the Application.

Seller's interest will not be represented by existing parties. Currently, the only parties to this proceeding are the Utility and the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Division of Consumer Advocacy (the "Consumer Advocate").

As such, the Consumer Advocate does not have the same interest as Seller in this proceeding.
E. A Statement of the Expertise, Knowledge or Experience the Applicant Possesses with Regard to the Matter in Controversy.
The management and engineering teams of Seller have specialized, historical knowledge of the Project, as well as technical, financing, and development-related knowledge pertaining to similar projects, which Seller can utilize to assist the Commission in its analysis of the Application. As needed, Seller may also consult with or draw on the expertise of the management and engineering teams of its parent and affiliate companies, described above.
F. Whether the Applicant Can Aid the Commission bv Submitting an Affirmative Case.
Seller can aid the Commission by submitting an affirmative case in this proceeding.
As noted above, Seller is a party to the PPA and has first-hand knowledge of the Project and its history. Accordingly, Seller is able to assist with the development of the record and is able to support its position and make an affirmative case that the Application should be approved.
G. A Statement of the Relief Desired.
Based on the foregoing, Seller respectfully requests that this Motion be granted and that it be permitted to participate in this proceeding. Seller's participation in this proceeding is appropriate as it meets all of the requirements set forth in HAR § 16-601-
56.
