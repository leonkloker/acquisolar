BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I In the Matter of the Application of HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY INC.
DOCKET NO.
For Approval of Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation with Waiawa Phase 2 Solar, LLC.
HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.'S APPLICATION TO THE HONORABLE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I:
By this Application, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. ("Hawaiian Electric" or the "Company") seeks approval of a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation ("PPA" or "R DG PPA/') executed by the Company and Waiawa Phase 2 Solar, LLC ("Seller") and other matters relating to the Seller's proposed 30-megawatt ("MW") photovoltaic project paired with energy storage ("Project" or "Facility"). The Project will be located in Pearl City and Waipio, on the island of O'ahu. Pursuant to the Commission's guidance regarding the accelerated timeline for the Hawaiian Electric Companies' Stage 2 Request for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation and Energy Storage ("Stage 2 RFP"), approval of the PPA is sought by early 2021.1
1 See Docket No. 2017-0352, Order No. 36604, issued on October 9,2019, at 25: "The commission has repeatedly expressed that timely execution of the competitive procurement process is a central objective of this proceeding." EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The PPA is a product of the Company's Stage 2 RFP and is based on the renewable dispatchable generation contracting mechanism, which allows for better utilization ofthe Proj ect' s renewable resource by Hawaiian Electric and facilitates the increasing contribution from new renewable resources, while mitigating the financial risk associated with curtailment for Seller. The PPA gives Hawaiian Electric dispatch rights over the renewable energy facilities (both generation and storage). In exchange, the Seller is provided a fixed monthly payment ("Lump Sum Payment"), which is subject to adjustment based on the availability and performance ofthe Facility.
Hawaiian Electric's previous as-available power purchase agreements required that the energy produced by the associated facility be accepted by the Company based on the seniority of the project. This practice limited the ability to move to 100% renewable energy, as the contribution from newer renewable resources was necessarily less than older resources, and the energy-only compensation limited the ability to use resources for grid services such as operating reserves, or to operate each facility on the basis of overall benefit to grid operations. The energy-only contracts therefore hindered the Company's ability to increase renewable energy opportunities. In contrast, the RDG PPA enables Hawaiian Electric to use the facility to meet the system's energy and grid service requirements. This flexibility is critically important over the 20-year term of the PPA as Hawai'i progresses toward its goal of 100% renewables by 2045.
Hawaiian Electric has entered into a PPA with Seller for the proposed Project, which Seller represents will be capable of generating up to 107,595 MWh per year. The Project's solar photovoltaic ("PV") and storage components together will provide the Company with flexible, semi-dispatchable renewable energy. The Facility as a whole will provide grid services and 2-
energy to the Hawaiian Electric system. In particular, the storage capability of the Facility will allow the Company to store solar energy generated by the Facility to be delivered during times of available demand. When grid charging is permitted, the Company will also be able to store energy from other resources on the grid to allow for greater certainty of supply for periods of lower solar production.
As discussed in more detail herein, Hawaiian Electric respectfully submits that the PPA is reasonable and in the public interest and should be approved for the following reasons:
(a) Both the PPA and Project are consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies'2
PSIP Update Report.· December 2016,3 and the Commission's Inclinations;4
(b) The Project was selected through a competitive procurement process approved by the Commission and overseen by the Independent Observer, consistent with the Commission's Framework for Competitive Bidding.5 This process allowed the Company to choose a portfolio of projects, including this Project, to provide the contemplated benefits the Company was seeking as part of the Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu with competitive pricing;
(c) The PPA is expected to provide bill savings to Hawaiian Electric's customers over the contract term and for the modeled set of assumptions. It is estimated that, as a result of the PPA, a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer consuming 500 kilowatt-hours ('1<Wh") per month could save approximately $0.04 per month on average over the course of the term ofthe PPA. On a portfolio basis with the other projects selected in the Company's Stage 2

RFP process on the island of O'ahu, it is estimated that a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer consuming 500 kWh per month could save on average, approximately $0.99 per month,6
(d) Fossil fuel prices are volatile. The PPA will reduce customer exposure to fuel price volatility by adding renewable generation at a fixed price, which will result in reduced fossil fuel consumption;
(e) The Proj ect is not expected to increase curtailment of existing as-available renewable resources or impede consideration of additional renewable resources to Hawaiian Electric's system;
(if) The Project will help to meet the State of Hawai'i's energy policy objectives and Renewable Portfolio Standards ("RPS") goals. The Facility is expected to increase Hawaiian Electric's 2025 RPS by up to 1.61 percentage points, and increase the Hawaiian Electric Companies' consolidated 2025 RPS by up to 1.23 percentage points, thus contributing to the State's goal of greater energy security and energy self-sufficiency,7
(g) The Facility provides essential Grid Services as defined in the Integrated Grid Planning process as well as providing grid forming capability, black start, and the allowance to use the battery for grid charging pursuant to the terms of the PPA;
(11) As further discussed in Exhibit 3 to this Application, according to the modeling conducted, the Facility will reduce fossil fuel consumption by Hawaiian Electric's generating 6 The projected bill impact calculations are only intended to provide an illustrative example of potential customer bill savings. The specific assumptions and results used in the bill impact calculations are provided in the evaluation attached hereto as Exhibit 3. Changes to any of these assumptions would have an impact on the results of the analysis. For example, an event such as the current epidemic, if such were to occur during the term of the PPA could change fuel prices, load forecasts, and other assumptions which would change the results of the analysis.
1 See Exhibit 6. The RPS calculations are based on the fossil fuel displacement identified in Exhibit 3 to this Application. Time may be required to prove the capabilities of the Facility as the operation of the systems displaces conventional plants that provide inertial response and other grid services before such replacement is realized in full.

units. It is estimated from these results that the Facility has the potential to displace about 2,908,097 barrels of fossil fuel over the term of the PPA; and (i) The PPA incorporates the Renewable Dispatchable Generation contracting mechanism that will improve on the Company's ability to leverage maximum value from this and subsequent renewable resources.8
I. REOUESTED APPROVALS Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission issue two decisions and orders as follows:
1. First Decision and Order Request: Approval of Power Purchase Agreement (a) Approve the PPA, by and between Hawaiian Electric and Seller,9
for the Project, as further described below and attached hereto as Exhibit 1;

Confidentiality Justification Table V. JUSTIFICATION Approval ofthe Project and PPA is reasonable and in the public interest for the following reasons:
(a) Consistent with the Commission's Inclinations. In the Commission's Inclinations, the Commission offered "perspectives on the vision, business strategies and regulatory policy changes required to align the HECO Companies' business model with customers' interests and the state's public policy goals."14 Specifically, the Commission's Inclinations urged the Hawaiian Electric Companies to seek higher penetrations of lower-cost renewables and to lower fuel costs in existing power plants.15 The PPA is consistent with these inclinations. Among other things, as noted in this Application, the PPA will increase renewable 12 A redacted version of Exhibit 3 is attached in support of this Application.

energy generation on the system and decrease the amount of fossil fuel consumption by existing power plants, thereby lowering fossil fuel purchases;
(b) Result of Competitive Procurement. The Project was selected through a competitive procurement process for defined target quantities and operation dates. This process allowed the Company to choose a portfolio of projects, including this Project, to provide the contemplated benefits the Company was seeking as part ofthe Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu at competitive pricing. The competitive procurement process is further described in Exhibit 2;
(c) Provides Essential Grid Services. The Project is advantageous due to the ability for the Company to dispatch the Facility's available energy in real time, allowing the Facility to potentially contribute to many ofthe grid services as proposed in the Integrated Grid Planning process16 traditionally provided by conventional synchronous generation, including: Regulating Reserve, Primary Frequency Response, and Voltage Support. Hawaiian Electric will be able to dispatch energy from the Project's PV or storage system as needed to serve customer demand outside solar production hours, and to provide replacement reserves. The Facility's technical and operational capabilities will contribute to grid stabilization for faults and contingencies, subj ect to Facility limits and energy availability. This allows the renewable Facility to provide energy and grid services rather than relying on fossil fuel firm conventional generation units to provide these services. The Project has the ability to be grid charged, allowing Hawaiian Electric greater flexibility and certainty in delivering necessary grid services. The Project can also operate in grid-forming mode, which facilitates maintaining system reliability in the future as the Company reduces or eliminates use of fossil-fueled synchronous units. Although grid-forming inverters 16 See https://www.hawaiianelectric.com/documents/clean_energy_hawaii/integrated_grid_planning/stakeholder_engagem ent/working_groups/solution_evaluation_and_optimization/20200522_wg_seo_meeting_presentation_slides.pdf 9-
for use in a grid ofthe scale of the Company's service territory is still considered a nascent technology, these capabilities are prudent over the course ofthe 20 year PPA, as the Company expects increasing reliance on inverter-based resources. Finally, the Facility's available stored energy can be used to provide black start capability, supporting restoration of the grid after a system blackout and thereby adding to grid resilience;
(d) Renewable Dispatchable Generation PPA. The PPA was based on the model Renewable Dispatchable Generation PPA filed with the Stage 2 RFP. Specific terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the Company and Seller at arms-length and contain indemnification, insurance, and other provisions that will serve to protect the Company and its customers from certain risks associated with interconnecting the PV plus storage Facility.
Hawaiian Electric negotiated significant provisions to assess the Facility's availability and performance throughout the term to ensure Facility capabilities at any time it is dispatched during the Term, as further discussed in Exhibit 4;
(e) Reasonable Pricing for Customers. The Unit Price, as defined in the PPA, is advantageous in that it is fixed for the duration of the PPA, is not tied to the price of fossil fuels, and is anticipated to result in lower effective rates for customers based on modeled assumptions.
The PPA is therefore expected to provide bill savings to Hawaiian Electric's customers over the term of the contract. It is estimated that, as a result of the PPA, a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer consuming 500 kWh per month could save approximately $0.04 per month on average during the term ofthe PPA. On a portfolio basis with the other projects selected in the Company's Stage 2 RFP process on the island of O'ahu, it is estimated that as a result of the portfolio of Stage 2 RFP projects selected, a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer 10-
consuming 500 kWh per month could save on average approximately $0.99 per month; 17
(if) Reduces Fossil Fuel Consumption. As shown in Exhibit 3, the Facility is anticipated to have a substantial positive impact by decreasing Hawaiian Electric's future dispatch of oil-fueled units;
(g) Reduces GHG Emissions. Hawaiian Electric will submit a GHG analysis for the Project to the Commission within four weeks ofthis submittal ofthis Application. The estimated GHG emissions result will be presented in metric tons ("MI"') of carbon dioxide equivalent ("CO2e") and in kilograms of C(he per megawatt-hour ("MWh") for the Project lifetime.
Detailed calculations including assumptions and inputs will be properly documented and included with the accompanying GHG analysis report.
(h) Increase RPS. The renewable energy to be purchased from the Facility pursuant to the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the State of Hawai'i's RPS goals. As shown in Exhibit 6, Hawaiian Electric estimates that the Facility has the potential to contribute up to 1.61 percentage points of Hawaiian Electric's 2025 RPS and 1.23 percentage points towards the Hawaiian Electric Companies' consolidated 2025 RPS;
(i) Consistent with PSIP Obiectives and Decreases Reliance on Foreign Imported Oil. The Project is consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP objectives, which set forth the Companies' intention to competitively procure new grid-scale generation resources through detailed plans and actions for the years 2017 to 2021.18 The right to dispatch the Facility 17 The projected bill impact calculations are only intended to provide an illustrative example of potential customer bill savings. The specific assumptions and results used in the bill impact calculations are provided in the evaluation attached hereto as Exhibit 3. Changes to any of these assumptions would have an impact on the results of the analysis. For example, an event such as the current epidemic, if such were to occur during the term of the PPA could change fuel prices, load forecasts, and other assumptions which would change the results of the analysis.
18 See Docket No. 2014-0183. D&O 34696 at ES-1.
11-
under the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the goals set forth in Hawaiian Electric's PSIP19 to move towards energy independence and decreased reliance on foreign imported oil while maintaining reliability ofthe Company system. The Stage 2 RFP actually sought more generation than the Companies originally planned for following their Stage 1 RFP, therefore accelerating the Company's efforts to reach RPS targets; and 0) Reduced Customer Exposure to Volatilitv in Fuel Prices. The PPA reduces customer exposure to volatility in fuel prices. The PPA pricing is not linked to fossil fuel and is fixed over the term of the contract, meaning customers will not be subject to bill increases with rises in the price of fossil fuel. Further, as noted above, the PPA will result in a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New renewable energy will be generated displacing fossil fuels.
Historically, fuel prices have been volatile and will likely continue to be unpredictable.
Reducing generation from other resources dependent on fossil fuels protects customers from the volatility of fuel prices.
VI.
BACKGROUND A. Procedural Historv As noted above, this Project is the result of the Company's Stage 2 RFP. The Stage 2
RFP is a continuation of the Hawaiian Electric Companies' efforts in their Stage 1 Requests for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation for O'ahu issued in February 2018
("Stage 1 RFP"). During the Stage 1 RFP, based on the PSIP identified resource needs through 2022, the Companies sought up to approximately 485,000 MWh of variable renewable dispatchable generation on O'ahu. During the Stage 1 RFP, the Hawaiian Electric Companies 19 See Docket No. 2014-0183. D&O 34696. at ES-2.
12-
indicated that they would procure any remaining MWh of renewable generation from the Stage 1
RFPs through a Stage 2 RFP.
On February 27, 2019, the Commission issued Order No. 36187, Providing Guidance in Advance ofthe Hawaiian Electric Companies ' Phase 2 Draft Requests for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation ("Order 36187"). Among other things, Order 36187
stated that the Hawaiian Electric Companies should conduct an RFP for renewable generation on the islands of O'ahu, Maui and Hawai'i to fulfill the remaining energy needs from the Stage 1
RFP as well as to meet the energy, capacity and ancillary services needs following the retirement ofthe AES Hawaii coal plant on O'ahu and the Kahului Power Plant on Maui. Order 36187 also noted that the Stage 2 RFP for Hawai'i Island "can and should build contingencies for uncertainties surrounding PGV and Hu Honua, recognizing the contingency benefits of procuring additional renewable resources on Hawai'i Island even if both PGV and Hu Honua are put into service, as planned."20 After a series oftechnical conferences before the Commission, advisory orders issued by the Commission, and filings by the Hawaiian Electric Companies, the Companies ultimately issued the Stage 2 RFP for O'ahu seeking up to 1,300,000 MWh of renewable energy, 200 MW of storage to fill the capacity need for the expiration of the AES Hawaii power purchase agreement, and 50 MW of contingency storage. Exhibit 2 provides a detailed summary ofthe RFP process.
The Stage 2 RFP required that projects have a Guaranteed Commercial Operations Date ("GCOD")21 no later than December 31, 2025, with the exception of projects that were intended to provide replacement capacity for AES Hawaii; such projects required a GCOD no later than m Order 36187 at 12-13.
21 Capitalized terms used, but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the PPA.
13-
June 1, 2022. The intent ofthe short timeframe for projects to reach commercial operations was to meet the Commission's stated objectives oftimely bringing on new renewable energy to displace fossil fuels. In order to meet these aggressive timelines, proposals could not require substantial infrastructure improvements in order to interconnect to the Company's system.
The Company notes that none of the Stage 2 RFP projects, including this Project, include the assumption of any Hawai'i State tax credit for renewable energy. Pursuant to Commission guidance in Order No. 36356, Providing Guidance on the Hawaiian Electric Companies ' Phase 2 Draft Requests for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation, Bsued on june 10, 2019, the Company removed the risk of changes in State tax policy from Seller2 and incorporated provisions in Attachment J of the PPA which requires the developer to pass through any State tax credit received to the Company's customers. Ifthe Project does end up being eligible for renewable energy tax credits from the State of Hawai'i, it would result in greater benefits for the Company's customers. However, the Company notes that the 2020 Hawai'i State Legislature recently passed S.B. No. 2820 S.D. 2 H.D. 223 that will end the State tax credit for utility scale solar energy projects over 5 MW that require a power purchase agreement to be approved by the Commission.
B. Policv Obiectives As noted above, this Project is consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP objectives. Further, the Project is consistent with many tenets of the State of Hawai'i's energy policy, which encourages the use and development of renewable energy.24 The Project will help 22 See Order No. 36356 at 24-25.

Hawaiian Electric meet the State's energy policy goals by reducing Hawaiian Electric's reliance on fossil fuels and implementing additional renewable energy resources, with the operational flexibility and technical characteristics to support 100% renewable goals. The State's overall energy objectives are set forth in HRS § 226-18(a), which states, in relevant part:
(a) Planning for the State's facility systems with regard to energy shall be directed toward the achievement of the following obj ectives, giving due consideration to all:
(1) Dependable, efficient, and economical statewide energy systems capable of supporting the needs of the people;
(2) Increased energy self-sufficiency where the ratio of indigenous to imported energy use is increased;
(3) Greater energy security and diversification in the face of threats to Hawaii's energy supplies and systems; [andl (4) Reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply and use.
The objectives in the area of renewable energy are to promote commercialization of Hawai'i's sustainable energy resources and technologies to reduce the State's high dependence on imported oil, increase local economic development, and reduce the potential negative economic impacts of oil price fluctuations. In support of these renewable energy objectives, Hawai'i's RPS law was established by the State Legislature in 2001, and amended in 2006,2009, and 2015. Pursuant to HRS § 269-92(a), each electric utility company25 that sells electricity for consumption in Hawai'i is required by law to establish a RPS of: (a) 30% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2020; (b) 40% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2030; (c) 70% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2040; and (d) 100% of its net electricity sales by 25 Pursuant to HRS § 269-93, "[aln electric utility company and its electric utility affiliates may aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve the [RPS]." 15-
December 31, 2045. In addition, HRS § 269-92(b)(1) requires that after December 31, 2014, the entire RPS be met by electrical energy generated using renewable energy sources, and HRS § 269-92(b)(2) requires that beginning January 1, 2015, electrical energy savings shall not count toward the RPS. The Project will assist Hawaiian Electric in satisfying these RPS goals, and will give Hawaiian Electric the opportunity to increase its annual RPS contribution on average 1.65
percentage points over the 20-year term ofthe PPA, and increase the Hawaiian Electric Companies' annual consolidated RPS on average 1.25 percentage points;26as further shown in Exhibit 6.
C. Greenhouse Gas Emissions The renewable energy objectives also encompass HRS § 269-6(b) which requires that the Commission:
[Clonsider the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels through energy efficiency and increased renewable energy generation in exercising its authority and duties under this chapter.
In making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs of utility system capital improvements and operations, the [Clommission shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, expert of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions. The [Clomission may determine that short-term costs or direct costs that are higher than alternatives relying more heavily on fossil fuels are reasonable, considering the impacts resulting from the use of fossil fuels.
The methodology described below will be utilized to estimate the GHG emissions associated with the proposed Project. Hawaiian Electric will submit the GHG analysis as described below, to the Commission within four weeks of this submittal.

The Transportation and Construction Stages' GHG emissions are calculated using an "inventory approach" where estimated direct GHG emissions from transportation and construction are calculated based on Project- and location-specific data. This includes Upstream and Downstream transportation for material and equipment from manufacturer locations which are mostly off-island to the Project site, and from the Project site to disposal locations. The Construction Stage includes GHG emissions produced during construction ofthe Project, including on-road and off-road construction GHG emissions associated with site development, -17-
foundation or civil work, and installation of new equipment.
2. Operations Stage Operations Emissions include direct GHG emissions associated with the operation and maintenance ofthe Project (e.g., the "Operations Stage" shown in Figure 1). The Operations Stage includes GHG emissions generated from operation and maintenance activities ofthe equipment and materials in scope for the Project, including: onsite energy; material and water use; mobile trips required for worker commute; and maintenance or other operational mobile trips.
3. Downstream Stages The Downstream Stages include GHG emissions from transportation, distribution, decommissioning and disposal of the proposed equipment at such time the Project is decommissioned after the projected Project lifetime.
4. Avoided Emissions Avoided emissions will be analyzed using the projected amount of fossil fuel that will be avoided as a result ofthe Project for the duration ofthe PPA and as further discussed in Exhibit 3 of this Application. The analysis will focus solely on direct emissions, since those emissions alone are expected to be significantly higher than those ofthe Project and represent the majority of projected GHG emissions from avoided fuel consumption if the Project were not built.
5. Net GHG Emissions Net GHG Emissions will demonstrate the benefits of the Project over the avoided in terms of GHG emissions. Estimated Net GHG Emissions are defined as the estimated Avoided GHG Emissions from Fossil-Fueled Plants minus estimated GHG emissions from the 18-
Project. The lower the Project's GHG Emissions relative to the Avoided GHG Emissions, the higher the Net Emissions reduction.
6. Report As previously stated, Hawaiian Electric will submit the GHG analysis as described above to the Commission within four weeks ofthis Application. The estimated GHG emissions result, using the methodology described above, will be presented in MTs of COze and in kilograms of CO2e per MWh for the Project lifetime. Detailed calculations including assumptions and inputs will be properly documented and included with the accompanying GHG analysis report.
Accordingly, Commission approval of the PPA for the Project: (1) will give Hawaiian Electric the opportunity to increase its annual RPS contribution;27 (2) is consistent with the State's energy policy encouraging the use and development of renewable energy resources; (3) advances the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels and the reduction of GHG emissions as articulated in HRS § 269-6(b); and (4) promotes the State's overall energy objectives set forth in HRS § 226- 18(a).
VIL PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Description of Developer Waiawa Phase 2 Solar, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of AES Distributed Energy, Inc., which is in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of The AES Corporation. AES Distributed Energy, Inc. has over 200 MW of operating solar projects, including a 28 MW PV plus 100
MWh BESS project on Kaua'i, and over 300 MW in development, including 100 MW on O'ahu, 27 See Exhibit 6.
19-
Maui and Hawai'i Island. The AES Corporation is a Fortune 500 Global Power Company with 2019 revenues of $10 billion, and $34 billion in assets owned and managed.
B. Site and Facilitv The proposed Facility will be located on land particularly identified by Tax Map Key Nos. 196-004: 024,025,026,194:006: 036. The land secured by Seller is approximately 387
acres zoned urban. A map showing the general location ofthe Project site is attached as Exhibit The Facility, which will be located on portions of a much larger property, is located north of Pearl City and east of the H-2 Freeway and Ka Uka Boulevard interchange. It is bordered to the north by the Waiawa Correctional Facility and Mililani Memorial Park & Mortuary, and to the west and south by branches of Waiawa Stream. The H-2 Freeway is located beyond Waiawa Stream to the west. The area to the east of the property consists of conservation land associated with the Ko'olau Mountains. Nearby communities include Pacific Palisades and Pearl City to the south (beyond Waiawa Stream), and Waipi'o and Mililani to the west and north (beyond the H-2 Freeway).
This property was historically used for sugarcane cultivation but has been fallow since approximately 1983 and currently comprises vacant, undeveloped land. The Facility would be located within the northwest portion of the property, as shown on the map attached hereto as Exhibit 7. A separate solar project, which was selected by Hawaiian Electric as part of a previous phase of its RFP process, is currently being developed by a non-affiliated third-party developer in the eastern portion of the property.

Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller is responsible to construct,28 own and operate the proposed 30 MW Facility, including all Seller-owned interconnection facilities and all other equipment, devices, associated appurtenances owned, controlled, operated, and managed by Seller in connection with, or to facilitate, the production, generation, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of electric energy by Seller to Hawaiian Electric, in parallel with Hawaiian Electric's system. Electric energy produced by the Facility will be provided by Seller to Hawaiian Electric and delivered to the Point of Interconnection in response to Company dispatch of the Facility.
The Seller expects that this Project, if approved, would support 120-150 construction jobs within the State of Hawai'i.29
Seller represents and warrants that, as ofthe Commercial Operations Date ofthe Facility ("COD"), the Facility will be a qualified renewable resource under the RPS in effect as ofthe effective date ofthe PPA ("Effective Date") and that, absent a change in RPS law, any and all energy delivered by Seller to Hawaiian Electric from or through the Facility will meet the definition of"renewable electrical energy"or "renewable energy" as defined under HRS § 269-
91.30
The Facility is capable of generating up to 30 MW and will consist of approximately 113,336 high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules mounted on a single-axis trackers and twelve 2.86 MW and two 1.43 MW inverters. Powered by solar energy with additional on-site battery energy storage, the Facility is capable of generating power used by up to 18,000 homes.
28 Seller, as a developer of renewable energy systems, intends to hire a properly licensed contractor to build the proposed renewable energy facility that is classified as an eligible resource under Hawai'i's RPS Statute, HRS §§ 269-91 - 269-95. See PPA at 1.
29 Estimated construction jobs are based on a similar size project. Seller is conducting a project-specific job and economic analysis.
'° See PPA at § 22.2(E) and preamble.
21-
Preliminary screening identified that an operational constraint may need to be imposed during operation due to existing terminal or reliability constraints on the Company's system. The Project was evaluated based on these preliminary limits, assuming no additional infrastructure or system improvements would be put in place, and such evaluation was taken into account during final selection. The IRS for the Project will determine the final operational constraint to be imposed.
The storage component of the Facility will comprise of a Battery Energy Storage System ("BESS") that will connect directly to the PV component ofthe Facility. An eight-hour, 30 MW, 240 MWh lithium-ion BESS is included. The BESS consists of battery modules, inverter systems, and switchgear. The BESS will charge from energy collected by the PV component of the Facility. The BESS will also have the ability to charge from energy provided by the Hawaiian Electric grid upon the expiration of the federal investment tax credit recapture period.
The key benefit of the PV plus storage Facility, contracted through the RDG PPA, is that the Company will be able to utilize renewable energy produced by the Facility during periods of system demand, outside of PV production hours. Having the PV system paired with the BESS adds significant value to the Facility by allowing the energy produced during the day that cannot be readily accepted by the Company to be stored and dispatched to the Company's system at future times of higher customer demand, which is more beneficial to the Company's system than past projects that required instantaneous use of energy produced. The BES S energy supplements the PV energy in meeting the Company's dispatch and thereby reduces volatility and variability ofthe PV energy resource, allowing the Facility to be semi-dispatchable and able to contribute to reserves. The storage allows the PV energy to be shifted to periods of peak energy demand, and other non-solar periods, that could otherwise require fossil generation to meet. The charged 22-
storage contributes to the primary frequency response of the Facility, and can assist in grid stabilization subject to discharge limits. See Exhibit 3, Attachment 8 for the representative dispatch ofthe Project.
The Seller's receipt of the full Lump Sum Payment per payment period is contingent on the Facility meeting the specific Performance Metrics specified in the PPA. If the Facility fails to satisfy one or more ofthe Performance Metrics, liquidated damages will be assessed against the full Lump Sum Payment amount. Liquidated damages tied directly to the capacity ofthe BESS will be assessed based on the BESS Allocated Portion of the Lump Sum Payment, which is a percentage of the full Lump Sum Payment. The Lump Sum Payment, as affected by liquidated damages for the availability ofthe Facility and other Performance Metrics, has the potential to reduce down to zero if the Facility is completely unavailable or if the Facility is available but underperforming in other aspects as measured by the Performance Metrics. See Exhibit 4 for further information regarding the PPA Performance Metrics and Liquidated Damages Assessment.
VIII. INTERCONNECTION The Facility will interconnect to the Company's existing Waiau-Mililani 46 kV and Wahiawa-Waimano 46 kV circuits. To ensure the Project is completed in a timely manner and to preserve the Seller's ability to seek the federal investment tax credits that began to phase out in 2019 and are scheduled to expire in 2022, but which can be safe harbored and claimed after 2022, the Parties agreed to execute the PPA prior to the completion ofthe IRS for the Project.31
Following completion ofthe IRS, the Parties will execute an Interconnection Requirements Amendment, substituting new versions of attachments to the PPA, including, but not limited to, 31 See PPA § 12.4.
23-
Attachment A (Description of Generation, Conversion and Storage Facility), Attachment B (Facility Owned by Seller), Attachment E (Single-Line Drawings), Attachment F (Relay List and Trip Scheme), Attachment G (Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities), Attachment K (Guaranteed Project Milestones), Attachment L (Reporting Milestones), and Attachment N (Acceptance Test General Criteria) to reflect the results of the IRS.32 The Interconnection Requirements Amendment will also reflect the Company's estimate of total interconnection costs based on the results ofthe IRS, as well as the Project development schedule agreed to by the Company and Seller. The Company will submit the Interconnection Requirements Amendment to the Commission in a subsequent informational filing.
Pursuant to Section 12.4(b) of the PPA, if Seller is dissatisfied with the results of the IRS (because, for example, ofthe technical requirements imposed or the cost of the interconnection work), Seller has the option, by written notice delivered to the Company no later than the Termination Deadline,33 to declare the PPA null and void.
Notably, the PPA does not allow for any adjustment to pricing upon completion ofthe IRS and interconnection cost estimates.
IX.
PPA TERMS AND CONDITIONS The terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the Parties at arms-length. The PPA contains indemnification, insurance, pricing, and other provisions, including those pertaining to the Term, Seller's delivery of dispatchable energy from the Facility, and Seller's compliance with laws, which will serve to protect the Company and its customers from certain 32 See PPA § 12.4(a).
33 As defined in the PPA, "Termination Deadline" means the 14th day following the date the completed IRS (including the Total Estimated Interconnection Costs and project schedule completed by Company) is provided to Seller, or such later date as Company and Seller may agree to by a written agreement.
24-
risks associated with interconnecting with the Facility. Moreover, the terms and conditions of the PPA will not affect the Company's ability to provide electric service to its customers and are not discriminatory to other small power producers. Hawaiian Electric maintains that, for these reasons, the purchased power arrangements (i.e., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric purchases rights to dispatch energy from Seller's Facility, are prudent and in the public interest.
Pursuant to Section 12.3(b) ofthe PPA, Seller shall seek participation without intervention in the Commission Docket for the approval of this Application for the limited purpose and only to the extent necessary to assist the Commission in making an informed decision regarding the approval of the PPA. The scope of Seller's participation shall be determined by the Commission.
A detailed summary and discussion ofthe key terms and conditions ofthe RDG PPA is set forth in the document entitled "Key PPA Terms and Conditions", attached hereto as Exhibit X. COMMUNITY OUTREACH Pursuant to the community outreach requirements set forth in the RFP, Seller was required to develop a comprehensive community outreach and communications plan to work with and inform neighboring communities and stakeholders about the Project and to gain support for the Project. Seller agreed to provide information to the neighboring communities and stakeholders on a timely basis during all phases of the Project. Seller's community engagement document is a public document and Seller was required to create a Project website that contained 25-
meaningful information about the proposed Project as well as their community outreach plan.34
The Company's Renewable Project Status Board was updated to identify all Final Award Group Projects and provided links to those individual Project websites in a consolidated location for interested community members and stakeholders.35 Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Seller was required to conduct a virtual public meeting either televised or online, and incorporate technology that allowed for live engagement and interaction between the Seller and community participants. The intent of the meeting was to gather stakeholders and other interested parties in the area to apprise the community about the Project, and to allow an opportunity for community concerns and questions to be raised. In addition, Seller was required to perform media outreach and advertising to raise community awareness of any public meeting. Seller was also required to account for the Project's potential impacts on historical and cultural resources and to share such information with the neighboring community. Further, Seller was required to designate an individual as the Seller' s Community Representative.
Article 29.21 of the PPA details the Seller's community outreach obligations during the entire development period, which include soliciting written community comments, and submitting all written community comments received by August 8,2020 as part of this Application.36 Seller' s current Community Representative is listed in Article 29.21 of the PPA.
Attached as Exhibit 8 are copies of public comments from Seller's community outreach efforts, as well as a summary of Seller' s community outreach efforts made to date.

XI.
ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation, addresses variable interest entities ("VIE") and primary beneficiaries (entities that consolidate VIEs). FASB ASC 810 could potentially require that the purchaser under a PPA, such as Hawaiian Electric, consolidate the Seller, such as Waiawa Phase 2 Solar, LLC. Ifthe PPA is determined to constitute a variable interest in Seller and that Hawaiian Electric is the primary beneficiary, then Hawaiian Electric will be required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements. Consolidating Seller onto Hawaiian Electric's financial statements will have uncertain impacts on the assessments of investors and/or credit rating agencies on the risks associated with this PPA and Hawaiian Electric's creditworthiness.
In addition, if Hawaiian Electric is required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements, then Hawaiian Electric's management will be required to assess the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting, in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Hawaiian Electric is unwilling to be subject to accounting treatment that results from VIE treatment as set forth in FASB ASC 810.37
A preliminary consolidation evaluation of the PPA and Seller was performed under FASB ASC 810, and it appears consolidation is not required. An evaluation will be performed when Commission approval is received. Thereafter, FASB ASC 810 requires Hawaiian Electric to continuously reassess its evaluation on an on-going basis.

A. Lease Accounting FASB ASC 842, Leases, effective January 1, 2019, specifies tests to be applied to an arrangement, in this case, the PPA, to determine: (1) whether or not the arrangement contains a lease and specifies the circumstances under which an arrangement should be evaluated to determine whether or not it contains a lease; and (2) if it is deemed a lease, whether it is an operating or finance lease.
If the PPA is deemed a lease, it would be classified as either an operating or a finance lease. If it is deemed an operating lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset, lease obligation and lease expense. If the PPA is deemed a finance lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset, lease obligation and related interest and amortization expense.
A preliminary evaluation of the PPA was performed under FASB ASC 842, which resulted in the identification ofthe PV system and the BESS as separate units of account for lease consideration. Based on the preliminary evaluation, the PV system was concluded to not contain a lease, while the BESS was concluded to contain a lease. As such, a right-of-use asset and lease liability will be recorded on Hawaiian Electric's financial statements for the present value of the fixed payments attributable to the BESS over the term ofthe PPA. A final evaluation will be performed upon Commission approval ofthe PPA.
For U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") purposes, ifthe PPA or a portion thereof is an operating lease, the lease expense would be straight-lined throughout the term of the lease, and ifthe PPA or portion thereof is a finance lease, the lease will have a front-loaded expense recognition. However, Hawaiian Electric requests that for rate-making purposes, the actual payments under the PPA be recorded as a purchase power expense and the 28-
difference between the actual payments and the lease expense be reflected as a regulatory asset/liability for the entire term of the PPA.
B. Impact of Imputed Debt on Credit Oualitv The payments Hawaiian Electric is required to make under this PPA are for availability and performance of renewable dispatchable generation, as well as the energy dispatched by the Company, as set forth in the PPA. A preliminary evaluation ofthe PPA was performed and it appears that the PV system does not contain a lease, while the BESS appears to contain a lease.
Since the PV system appears to not contain a lease, there is no recorded liability for the long-
term lease expense payment attributable to the PV system. However, credit rating agencies would reflect these obligations as imputed debt in the ratios used to evaluate Hawaiian Electric's risk profile, which drive the resulting credit rating. Since the BESS unit appears to contain a lease, a right-of-use asset and lease liability will be recorded. The Company's understanding is that Standard & Poor's ("S&P") will continue to use this information in its analysis and will use the lease liability in calculating the debt to be imputed for PPA-related fixed obligations. On May 7,2007, S&P published an article titled "Standard & Poor's Methodology For Imputing Debt For U.S. Utilities' Power Purchase Agreements" ("S&P's 5-7-07 Article"). In this article, S&P imputes debt for fixed PPA obligations and includes this imputed debt in its analysis of a company's financial metrics.
New lease accounting rules effective January 1, 2019 will require all leases with terms greater than twelve months to be included on the balance sheet. On April 16,2018, S&P published a Credit FAQ titled "What Do New Lease Accounting Changes Mean For Corporate Credit Ratings?" ("S&P's 4-16-18 Article"). In this article, S&P states:
[Florthcoming changes to lease accounting within international and U.S. accounting standards that come into force from 2019 will 29-
generally not affect S&P Global Ratings' view of the creditworthiness of companies it rates, because nothing will be changing about the underlying credit fundamentals of these companies. That said, we do not rule out the possibility that, in certain cases, the new financial reporting might highlight new information that we will need to factor into our analysis. Yet, although some components of certain individual credit ratings might change, we expect the overall effect to be limited.38
For companies that follow U. S. GAAP, S&P expects to continue applying current methodology for operating leases.39
Hawaiian Electric prepared estimates ofthe imputed debt and rebalancing costs based on S&P's methodology as described. Imputed debt at inception is estimated to be approximately $34.960 million, with annual rebalancing costs estimated at about $1.670 million.
XIL AUTHORITY FOR REOUESTED APPROVALS A. General The approvals in this Application are requested pursuant to Sections 226-18,269-6, 269-
16.22, 269-27.2, 269-91 and 269-92 ofthe Hawai'i Revised Statutes; Section 16-601-74 ofthe Hawai'i Administrative Rules ("HAR"); Order No. 36474 Approving the Hawaiian Electric Companies ' Phase 2 Draft Requests for Proposals, with Modifications, issued on August 15, 2019 in Docket No. 2017-0352; Decision and Order No. 34696, issued on July 14, 2017 in Docket No. 2014-0183 (PSIP docket); and other statutory and regulatory authorities as specifically set forth below.
38 S&]?'s 4-16-18 Article at 1.
39 In this regard, S&P's 4-16-18 Article (at 4) states:
Under our current methodology for operating leases, the lease-related expense is allocated to interest and depreciation. Interest expense is increased by the product of the 7% standard discount rate we currently use, multiplied by the average net present value of the lease payments for the current and previous years. Additionally, our EBITDA calculation increases because we add back in the interest and depreciation. We expect to continue applying this approach for companies that follow U. S. (MAP.

B. PPA Approval This Application is filed pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure Before the Public Utilities Commission ofthe State of Hawai'i, Title 16, Chapter 601, ofthe Hawai'i Administrative Rules. Commission approval ofthis PPA, purchased energy charges, if applicable, and Lump Sum Payments is sought pursuant to HRS § 269-27.2 and HAR Chapter 6-
74, as amended, which generally guide the Commission's review of the rates agreed upon between Hawaiian Electric and Seller. Specifically, HRS § 269-27.2(c) provides, in relevant part:
The rate payable by the public utility to the producer for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility shall be as agreed between the public utility and the supplier and as approved by the public utilities commission; provided that in the event the public utility and the supplier fail to reach an agreement for a rate, the rate shall be as prescribed by the public utilities commission according to the powers and procedures provided in this chapter.
The commission' s determination of the just and reasonable rate shall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels and the rate for the non-fossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost savings resulting from the use of non-fossil fuel generated electricity. As the commission deems appropriate, the just and reasonable rate for non-fossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility by the producer may include mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments, such as adjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or other acceptable adjustment mechanisms.
HAR § 6-74-22(a) also provides that the rates for purchase shall:
(1) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest;
(2) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities; and 31-
(3) Be not less than one hundred per cent of avoided cost for energy and capacity purchases to be determined as provided in [HAR §] 6-74-23 from qualifying facilities and not less than the minimum purchase rate.40
As such, Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests the Commission: (i) approve the PPA, (ii) find that the purchased power arrangements under the PPA are prudent and in the public interest; and (iii) find that the Lump Sum Payment to be paid pursuant to the PPA is just and reasonable based on the information provided in this Application and its Exhibits. In particular, see Section V. (Justification) of this Application setting forth the reasons that approval of the Project and the PPA is reasonable and in the public interest.
C. Purchased Power Adiustment Clause The total Lump Sum Payments, as defined in the PPA, are payments made by Hawaiian Electric to Seller in exchange for Seller making the Net Energy Potential of the Facility available for dispatch by the Company.41 The amount of energy delivered by the Facility to the Company is not a factor in calculating the Lump Sum Payment for any given period. Using the availability ofthe Facility and its Net Energy Potential as a basis for Lump Sum Payments limits the developer' s financial risk associated with excess energy curtailment, as seen in PPAs for prior projects, while at the same time ensuring favorable pricing to benefit customers for the term of the PPA.
HRS § 269-16.22 provides:
All power purchase costs, including costs related to capacity, operations and maintenance, and other costs that are incurred by an 4° Notwithstanding, HAR § 6-74-15(b)(1) states that nothing in HAR Title 6, Chapter 74, Subchapter 3 (i.e., HAR §§ 6-74-15 to 28) "[p]rohibits an electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subchapter[.]]„ 41 See PPA, "Schedule of Defined Terms" for definition of Lump Sum Payment.
32-
electric utility company, arising out of power purchase agreements that have been approved by the public utilities commission and are binding obligations on the electric utility company, shall be allowed to be recovered by the utility from the customer base of the electric utility company through one or more adjustable surcharges, which shall be established by the public utilities commission. The costs shall be allowed to be recovered if incurred as a result of such agreements unless, after review by the public utilities commission, any such costs are determined by the commission to have been incurred in bad faith, out of waste, out of an abuse of discretion, or in violation of law. For purposes of this section, an "electric utility company" means a public utility as defined under section 269- 1, for the production, conveyance, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of electric power.
Accordingly, Commission authorization is requested to include the total Lump Sum Payments that are incurred by Hawaiian Electric through' the Company's PPAC, as may be applicable, to the extent such costs are not included in base rates.
