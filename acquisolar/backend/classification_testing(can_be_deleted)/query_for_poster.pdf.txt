You are a pragmatic Solar M&A Senior Analyst in the United States. You are about to get instructions to extract information from documents. This information will be used to add meta data, create a summary and sort the documents.

Extract the following fields from the document text provided and format the response as valid JSON:
- "Document_date" in the format '3 letter month name-DD, YYYY'.
- "Document_summary" limited to a maximum of 3 sentences, tailored for a solar M&A analyst. It should state what kind of document it is, but also what its implicatoins are or what state it is in. It should assume the analyst knows about the M&A process.
- "Suggested_title" in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY max 5 word document title'. Try your best to come up with a title that is useful if you quickly want to understand what kind of document it is
- "Suggested_title_v2" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Suggested_title_v3" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Document_folder_path": Select the most suitable folder from the folder list which will be given. Follow instructions below. 
- "Document Label": "Communication", "Contract", "Amendment", "Technical Specification", "Application", "Exhibit",
- "Reasoning": Provide reasoning for every documents you classified. 

For "Document_folder_path", please follow these guidelines: 

    1. Do not create new folders. Documents must be classified based on existing categories, according to their primary content and purpose.

    2. Classify documents with precision, using these category definitions:

        "Interconnection": Contains contracts and agreements for connecting the solar project to the power grid. Look for phrases like "the interconnection customer agrees" and "interconnection requests".

        "Site Control": Includes legal documents that confirm the right to use, manage, and develop land for solar projects. This category is crucial for affirming legal authority over project sites and includes leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

        "PPA": Features power purchasing agreements between the project developer and an off-taker regarding the sale of generated solar power, detailing prices, terms, and standards, as well as supplementary documents.  

        "Environmental": Documents related to environmental impact assessments, permits, and compliance reports for the solar project. Includes studies on flora, fauna, water, soil, and air quality impacts, as well as mitigation strategies.

        "EPC": Contains contracts, plans, and documentation related to the engineering design, procurement of materials, and construction of the solar project. This includes agreements with contractors, project timelines, and construction permits.

    3. Prioritize document essence and main purpose for classification. In cases of uncertainty or documents that span multiple categories, classify according to the document's primary focus.
    4. Only classify documents as "Miscellaneous" if no other folder is likely. 
The list of to select folders from below:
  - Environmental
  - EPC
  - Interconnection
  - Permitting
  - PPA
  - Site Control
  - Miscellaneous

RNA SHAPE Prediction James Swomley 1

1Stanford University, Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering Overview The ability to easily compute the local reactivity of each nucleotide in an RNA sequence is an important interme-
diate step allowing researchers to then determine the sec-
ondary and tertiary structure of a given RNA molecule. In this project, we built an ML model that accurately computes these reactivity values using only the RNA sequence as in-
put. Our best model consists of a BERT-style foundation model with an appended GRU prediction head.
Background The secondary and tertiary structure of an RNA molecule are crucial to its transcription of proteins, since they determine the reactivity of its individual nucleotides.
Figure 1. An RNA sequence and its secondary and tertiary structure Directly measuring the structure of individual RNA molecules remains difficult even with modern methods such as cryo-EM.
To bridge the gap between RNA sequence and structure, we introduce selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension, or SHAPE data [1], which consists of a scalar value for each nucleotide that measures its reactivity. SHAPE data is expected to completely encode tertiary structure.
⇒ A model that computes SHAPE data from RNA sequence could very rapidly create a massive dataset enabling the development of new model that predicts tertiary structure.
Methods Three main types of models were deployed.
1. Basic sequence model: A sequence model (GRU/LSTM/Transformer/CNN) is trained from scratch directly on the RNA sequence to predict SHAPE.
2. Sequence model trained on foundation model embeddings: RNA sequences are passed through RNA-FM [2] to generate embeddings, then a sequence model (the prediction head) is trained on those embeddings. RNA-FM is a BERT-style self-supervised foundation model trained on a massive corpus of unannotated RNA sequences.
3. Fine-tuned foundation model: Some of RNA-FM’s transformer blocks are left unfrozen to train along with an appended prediction head.
Figure 2. Model Outline Experimental data about the RNA’s secondary structure can also improve our model without changing its objective. By adding another prediction head that predicts whether each nucleotide is bound or unbound and incorporating this in our loss function, we can force the model to learn structural in-
formation that is closely related to SHAPE profile, improving SHAPE prediction accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics The loss function used in all experiments is L1 loss. More-
over, the performance of the model is also evaluated by the median of the Pearson correlation coefficients:
rseq = Pn i=1(yi − ¯y)(y∗ i − ¯y∗) pPn i=1(yi − ¯y)2
qPn i=1(y∗ i − ¯y∗)2
where yi and y∗ i are the experimental and predicted SHAPE values at nucleotide i of the sampled sequence, respec-
tively. ¯y and ¯y∗ denote their mean values.
Experiments All 4 sequence models were trained in setting (1) and (2) with similar sizes of ∼1.5M parameters for comparability.
