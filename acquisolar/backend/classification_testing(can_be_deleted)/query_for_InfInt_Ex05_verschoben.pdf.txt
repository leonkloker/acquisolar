You are a pragmatic Solar M&A Senior Analyst in the United States. You are about to get instructions to extract information from documents. This information will be used to add meta data, create a summary and sort the documents.

Extract the following fields from the document text provided and format the response as valid JSON:
- "Document_date" in the format '3 letter month name-DD, YYYY'.
- "Document_summary" limited to a maximum of 3 sentences, tailored for a solar M&A analyst. It should state what kind of document it is, but also what its implicatoins are or what state it is in. It should assume the analyst knows about the M&A process.
- "Suggested_title" in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY max 5 word document title'. Try your best to come up with a title that is useful if you quickly want to understand what kind of document it is
- "Suggested_title_v2" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Suggested_title_v3" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Document_folder_path": Select the most suitable folder from the folder list which will be given. Follow instructions below. 
- "Document-label": "Communication", "Contract", "Amendment", "Technical Specification", "Application", "Exhibit",
- "Reasoning": Provide reasoning for every documents you classified. 

For "Document_folder_path", please follow these guidelines: 

    1. Do not create new folders. Documents must be classified based on existing categories, according to their primary content and purpose.

    2. Classify documents with precision, using these category definitions:

        "Interconnection": Contains contracts and agreements for connecting the solar project to the power grid. Look for phrases like "the interconnection customer agrees" and "interconnection requests".

        "Site Control": Includes legal documents that confirm the right to use, manage, and develop land for solar projects. This category is crucial for affirming legal authority over project sites and includes leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

        "PPA": Features power purchasing agreements between the project developer and an off-taker regarding the sale of generated solar power, detailing prices, terms, and standards, as well as supplementary documents.  

        "Environmental": Documents related to environmental impact assessments, permits, and compliance reports for the solar project. Includes studies on flora, fauna, water, soil, and air quality impacts, as well as mitigation strategies.

        "EPC": Contains contracts, plans, and documentation related to the engineering design, procurement of materials, and construction of the solar project. This includes agreements with contractors, project timelines, and construction permits.

    3. Prioritize document essence and main purpose for classification. In cases of uncertainty or documents that span multiple categories, classify according to the document's primary focus.
    4. Only classify documents as "Miscellaneous" if no other folder is likely. 
The list of to select folders from below:
  - Environmental
  - EPC
  - Interconnection
  - Permitting
  - PPA
  - Site Control
  - Miscellaneous

2. Schema Mapping (Sample exam question) The ﬁgure below shows a source and a target schema with foreign key constraints (dashed lines) and a logical mapping between them (solid lines).
PID$ Name$ Date_of_Birth$ street$ City$ Zip$ Person' ANR$ Type$ Balance$ A_PID$ Account' Person' name$ Address' Street$ zip$ City' Zip$ City$ Accounts' type$ Account' ANR$ overdra@$ Apply the algorithm discussed in class to identify all interpretations of the given correspondences (i.e., determine all candidate schema mappings). In particular, your solution should include:
a) A list of all identiﬁed intra-schema associations (obtained after deter-
mining primary paths and considering foreign key constraints). To identify each association, provide the set of all bold-font labels associated with an association. For instance, for an association including Product and Busi-
nessSectors from the target schema, write {Product, BusinessSectors}. Give each association a name, using Si (S1, S2, ...) for source associations ans Ti for target associations.
b) Complete the table depicted below. That is, for each association combina-
tion identiﬁed by the pair of source and targer association, say if it is a valid combination or, if not, if it is pruned due to (i) correspondences outgoing from the source that do not ﬁnd a target or (ii) correspondences incoming to the target that do not originate from the source. The ﬁgure with the mappings is repeated for your convenience Source association Target association Is valid?
Invalid due to (i) Invalid due to (ii) 3. GaV modelling We are given the following global and local schemas and integrity constraints (ICs):
Global schema:
Books(title, author, year, category) Local schemas S1: PopularBooks(title, author, year, category) S2: RecentBooks(title, author, year) (IC: year > 2010) S3: AntiqueBooks(title, author, category) S4: NewBooks(title, author, category) (IC: year > 2015) S5: ScienceBooks(title, author) (IC: Jahr = 2016, category = " science") a) Create a Global as View (GaV) model for the above setting.
b) Are there any sources that cannot be modelled and hence not be used for query answering. If so, explain why.
c) Does your model include optional WHERE clauses that are however useful to be modelled as they can provide valuable hints to the query optimizer.
d) For each of the following queries to the global schema, identify the (modelled) sources that • fully contribute to the result • do not contribute to the result and if so, they could however contain relevant data Q1: SELECT * FROM Books Q2: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE year > 2014
Q3: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE category = "fiction" Q4: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE year < 2014
Q5: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE year > 2014 AND category = " science" Q6: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE year > 2014 AND category = " fiction" e) Let us now add the following ICs to the global schema. Which sources cannot be modelled? Brieﬂy explain why.
year > 2010, category = "science" f) Which of the queries Q1 to Q6 given in 3d) can be answered given the ICs added to the global schema in 3e). For those, identify the sources that con-
tribute to the result.
g) Based on the GaV model, we are able to perform query planning, i.e., identify which sources can be used. Using the GaV model analyzed through the above questions, which query will be sent to the next step of query processing (in this case query optimization assuming no data model heterogeneity).
