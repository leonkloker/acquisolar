because of a Force Majeure condition (i) at the Facility or (ii) that otherwise delays or prevents the Seller from making the Facility inverter(s) in question available for Company Dispatch, as more fully set forth in Section 3.iv of Attachment J (Company Payments for Energy, Dispatchability and Availability of BESS) to this Agreement.
If only the BESS is unavailable due to Force Majeure, the Lump Sum Payment shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the BESS Allocated Portion of the Lump Sum Payment for each Day or portion thereof during the calendar month in question that the BESS was not available to respond to Company Dispatch because of a Force Majeure condition (i) at the Facility or (ii) that otherwise delays or prevents the Seller from making the BESS available for Company Dispatch.
2.4
Assurance of Capability of Facility to Deliver Net Energy Potential and Availability of BESS.
(a) Design, Operation and Maintenance to Achieve Required Performance Metrics; Charging of BESS.
In order to provide Company with reasonable assurance that, subject to the Renewable Resource Variability, the Facility's Net Energy Potential will be available for Company Dispatch: (i) the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric shall be used to evaluate the availability of the PV System for dispatch by Company;
(ii) the Guaranteed Performance Ratio ("GPR") Performance Metric shall be used to evaluate the efficiency of the PV System; (iii) the BESS Capacity Performance Metric shall be used to confirm the capability of the BESS to discharge continuously for four (4) hours at Maximum Rated Output or to discharge continuously for a total energy (MWh) equal to the BESS Contract Capacity if the test is conducted at less than Maximum Rated Output; (iv) the BESS EAF Performance Metric shall be used to determine whether the BESS is meeting its expected availability; and (v) the BESS EFOF Performance Metric shall be used to evaluate whether the BESS is experiencing excessive unplanned outages.
Whenever the PV System potential output is in excess of the Company Dispatch, the excess energy from the PV System shall be used to maximize the BESS State of Charge so long as this does not conflict with the operating parameters of the BESS set forth in Section EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

9(d) (Battery Energy Storage System) of Attachment B (Facility Owned by Seller) to this Agreement.
Seller shall design, operate and maintain the Facility in a manner consistent with the standard of care reasonably expected of an experienced owner/operator with the desire and financial resources necessary to design, operate and maintain the Facility to achieve the Performance Metrics.
The foregoing is without limitation to Seller's other obligations under this Agreement, including the obligation to operate the Facility in accordance with Good Engineering and Operating Practices.
The Performance Metrics set forth in Section 2.5 (PV System Equivalent Availability Factor; Liquidated Damages; Termination Rights) through Section 2.9 (BESS Annual Equivalent Forced Outage Factor; Liquidated Damages) of this Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Generating Availability Data System ("NERC GADS") Data Reporting Instructions.
(b) [Reserved] 2.5
PV System Equivalent Availability Factor; Liquidated Damages; Termination Rights.
(a) Calculation of the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor.
Following the end of each LD Period, the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor shall be calculated for such LD Period as follows:
AH-EPDH-EUDH PV System Equivalent = 100% x PH Availability Factor where:
Period Hours (PH) is the total number of hours in the LD Period counting twenty-four (24) hours per day minus ExcludedTime.
In a normal year, PH = 8,760 minus ExcludedTime, and in a leap year PH = 8,784 minus ExcludedTime.
Available Hours (AH) is the number of hours that the PV System is not on Outage.
It is the sum of all Service Hours (SH) + Reserve Shutdown Hours (RSH).
EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.
ARTICLE 2

EXHIBIT 1
PAGE 11 OF 352
An "Outage" exists whenever the entire PV System is not online producing electric energy and is not in a Reserve Shutdown state, resulting from Seller-Attributable Non-
Generation but excluding ExcludedTime.
Service Hours (SH) is the number of hours during the LD Period the PV System is online and producing electric energy to meet Company Dispatch and/or to maintain the BESS State of Charge.
Reserve Shutdown Hours (RSH) is the number of hours the PV System was available to the Company System but not providing electric energy or is offline for reasons other than Seller-Attributable Non-Generation, or is offline due to insufficient irradiance levels based on the inverter manufacturer's minimum irradiance level for production.
All hours except for ExcludedTime between 7:00 pm and 6:00 am will be considered RSH.
The PV System will be considered RSH in these hours, even if the system would otherwise be in an outage or derated state.
A "Deration" exists if the Facility is available for Company Dispatch, but at less than full potential output for the given irradiance conditions.
Derations include only periods of Seller-Attributable Non-Generation and derations by Company pursuant to Section 8.3 (Company Rights of Dispatch).
Derations do not include periods of ExcludedTime.
Each individual Deration is transformed into equivalent full outage hour(s).
For derations due to inverter outages, this is calculated by multiplying the actual duration of the derating (hours) by the number of inverters in the PV System offline and dividing by the total number of inverters in the PV System.
For deration by Company pursuant to Section 8.3
(Company Rights of Dispatch), this is calculated by the size of the deration (in MW) divided by the Contract Capacity.
For avoidance of doubt, if the Facility is in an Outage it cannot also be in a Deration.
Equivalent Planned Derated Hours (EPDH) includes Planned Derations (PD) and Maintenance Derations (D4). A Planned Deration is when the PV System experiences a Deration scheduled well in advance and for a EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

predetermined duration.
A Maintenance Deration is a Deration that can be deferred beyond the end of the next weekend (Sunday at midnight or before Sunday turns into Monday) but requires a reduction in capacity before the next Planned Deration (PD).
Each individual Deration is transformed into equivalent full outage hour(s).
Equivalent Unplanned Derated Hours (EUDH):
An Unplanned Deration (Forced Deration) occurs when the PV System experiences a Deration that requires a reduction in availability before the end of the nearest following weekend.
Unplanned Derations include those due to Seller-Attributable Non-Generation.
Each individual Unplanned Deration is transformed into equivalent full outage hour(s).
This is calculated by multiplying the actual duration of the deration (in hours) by the number of inverters in the PV System offline and dividing by the total number of inverters in the PV System.
These equivalent hour(s) are then summed.
ExcludedTime is unavailability as a result of the PV System or a portion of the PV System being unavailable due to Force Majeure.
The hours and/or equivalent hours of ExcludedTime shall not be added to Available Hours and shall be subtracted from Period Hours.
This is calculated by multiplying the actual duration of the event that counts as ExcludedTime (in hours) by the number of inverters in the PV System offline and dividing by the total number of inverters in the PV System.
These equivalent hour(s) are then summed.
The effect of Force Majeure is taken into account in calculating the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor over the 12 calendar month LD Period as follows:
When an LD Period contains a month during which the PV System or a portion of the PV System is unavailable due to Force Majeure, then such month shall be excluded from the LD Period and the LD Period shall be extended back in time to include the next previous month during which there was no such unavailability of the PV System or a portion thereof due to Force Majeure.

included for illustrative purposes only.
Assume the following:
1. PV System has 10 inverters.
2. LD Period = first 12 calendar months of the Agreement (non-leap year).
3. PV System was online and producing electric energy for 4,000 hours and was available but not producing electric energy due to lack of sufficient irradiance for production (i.e., not Seller-Attributable Non-
Generation) for 500 hours.
4. 3 Inverters were offline for 100 hours due to a Planned Deration between the hours of 6 am and 7 pm.
5. 2 Inverters were offline for 50 hours due to an Unplanned Deration between the hours of 6 am and 7 pm (Seller-Attributable Non-Generation).
6. The PV System was offline for 10 hours due to Force Majeure, which occurred between the hours of 6 am and 7
Pm.
The PV System Equivalent Availability Factor would be calculated as follows:
Excluded Time = 10 hrs PH = 8,760 hours in 12 calendar months - 10 hours of Excluded Time = 8,750 hours SH = 4,000 hours RSH = 500 hours + (11 hours/day x 365 days) :
AH = SH + RSH = 4,000 hours + 4,515 hours :

EAF = 100% x = 96.9% 8,750
(b) PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages.
For each LD Period, a PV System Equivalent Availability Factor shall be calculated as provided in accordance with Section 2.5(a) (Calculation of PV System Equivalent Availability Factor) of this Agreement.
In the event the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor is less than 98% (the "PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric") for any LD Period, Seller shall be subject to liquidated damages as set forth in this Section 2.5(b) (PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages).
For avoidance of doubt, because the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor is calculated over an LD Period of 12 calendar months, the first month for which liquidated damages would be calculated under this Section 2.5(b) (PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages) would be the last calendar month of the initial Contract Year.
If the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor for a LD Period is less than the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric, Seller shall pay, and Company shall accept, as liquidated damages for Seller's failure to achieve the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric for such LD Period, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:
PV System Amount of Liquidated Damages Per Equivalent Calendar Month Availability Factor For each one-tenth of one percent 97.9% and below (0.001) by which the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor for such LD Period falls below the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric, an amount equal to 0.001917 of the Applicable Period Lump Sum Payment for the last calendar month of such LD Period.
EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.
ARTICLE 2

EXHIBIT 1
PAGE 15 OF 352
For purposes of determining liquidated damages under the preceding formula, the amount by which the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor for the LD Period in question falls below the applicable threshold shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent (0.001).
Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (i) the damages that Company would incur if the Seller fails to achieve the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric for a LD Period would be difficult or impossible to calculate with certainty and (ii) the aforesaid liquidated damages are an appropriate approximation of such damages.
EXAMPLE:
The following is an example calculation of liquidated damages for the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and is included for illustrative purposes only.
Assume the monthly Lump Sum Payment is $1,000,000 and the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor is 96.9% as calculated in the example in Section 2.5(a) (Calculation of the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor) above.
The liquidated damages would be calculated as follows:
Applicable Period Lump Sum Payment = $1,000,000
$1,000,000 x .001917 = $1,917
98.0% - 96.9% = 1.1% 1.1%/0.1% = 11
$1,917 x 11 = $21,087
(C) PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Termination Rights.
The Parties acknowledge that, although the intent of the liquidated damages payable under Section 2.5(b) (PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages) is to compensate Company for the damages that Company would incur if the Seller fails to achieve the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric for a LD Period, such liquidated damages are not intended to EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

EXHIBIT 1
PAGE 16 OF 352
compensate Company for the damages that Company would incur if a pattern of underperformance establishes a reasonable expectation that the PV System is likely to continue to substantially underperform the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric.
Accordingly, and without limitation to Company's rights under said Section 2.5(b) (PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages) for those LD Periods during which the Seller failed to achieve the PV System Equivalent Availability Factor Performance Metric, the failure of the Facility to achieve a PV System Equivalent Availability Factor of not less than 84% for each of three consecutive Contract Years shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 15.1(b) of this Agreement for which Company shall have the rights (including but not limited to the termination rights) set forth in Article 15 (Events of Default) and Article 16 (Damages in the Event of Termination by Company).
2.6 Measured Performance Ratio; Liquidated Damages; Termination Rights.
(a) Calculation of Measured Performance Ratio.
(i) The Measured Performance Ratio ("MPR") represents the PV System's measured DC power output compared to its theoretical DC power output as adjusted for the plane of array irradiance conditions measured at the Site.
The gross PV System output in MW and MVAR will be measured at the point to be identified on the Facility's single-line diagram attached hereto as Attachment E (Single-Line Drawing and Interface Block Diagram).
(ii) Following the end of each MPR Assessment Period, the MPR shall be calculated for such MPR Assessment Period (using the previous 12 months of data) as follows:
MPR= i PDC_i (GpoAT Ii IPDcsārc VEFF' Where:

EXHIBIT 1
PAGE 17 OF 352
i = each 15-minute interval during the MPR Assessment Period where the measured plan of array irradiance exceeds the manufacturer's minimum irradiance level for production Pnc is the measured DC power output of the PV System measured at the inverters DC input averaged over time period i (MW) Gsrc plane of array irradiance at the standard condition of 1000
PICsārc is the DC rated capacity of the PV System at the standard test conditions of 1000 W/m2 and 25'C (MW), (i.e., the DC power rating of the PV panels at standard test conditions multiplied by the number of PV panels in the Facility);
GpoA is the measured plane of array irradiance averaged over time period i (W/m2);
(iii) The time periods used in the foregoing calculation shall be only periods during which, for the entire 15-minute interval, the PV System output is allowed to convert all irradiance to gross DC power (whether directed to the BESS or to the POI) and the plane of array irradiance is not less than the manufacturer's minimum irradiance level for production.
Data points that may be excluded are limited to data points where there is indication that the inverter is limiting output of the PV array in response to Company signal or internal signal (such as battery SOC reaching 100%), identified by either internal/non-Company SCADA flag, or inverter DC voltage, as collected and supplied by the Facility SCADA system, indicating that the inverter is accepting maximum available PV current.
The aforementioned 15-minute intervals are fixed intervals that commence, in sequence, at the top of each hour and at 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour.
At the end of each month, Seller shall provide Company, as part of the Monthly Report, such data Ce.g., PV DC production at the inverter input, "PV curtailment" flag, and inverter DC voltage) from the Facility SCADA system as necessary to validate the exclusion of any data EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

This information shall be validated on a monthly basis.
(iv) The Measured Performance Ratio shall be calculated using the data for each 15-minute interval during the MPR Assessment Period that satisfies the conditions set forth in clause (iii) above.
The result of the foregoing calculation for the entire MPR Assessment Period shall be the MPR for the MPR Assessment Period in question.
EXAMPLE:
The following is an example of a Measured Performance Ratio calculation and is included for illustrative purposes only.
Assume the following:
1. Facility with 120,000 panels with a standard test condition rating of 300 W 2. PDcs'fc= 120,000 X 300 W = 36 MW 3. For illustrative purposes only, 4 hours of data which met the criteria specified in Section 2.6(a)(iii) have been recorded over the MPR Assessment Period.

EXHIBIT 1
PAGE 24 OF 352
For purposes of the foregoing calculations under this Section 2.6(c) (GPR Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages), the degradation factor (DF) is calculated for each Contract Year Ce.g., second Contract Year, third Contract Year, fourth Contract Year, etc.) as follows:
DF = 1- 0.005 * (Applicable Contract Year - 1) .
For purposes of the foregoing formula, the "Applicable Contract Year" is the Contract Year within which the calendar month in question falls.
If all of the months of an MPR Assessment Period fall within the same Contract Year, the Contract Year is the "Applicable Contract Year." For example, if all of the months of MPR Assessment Period fall within the third Contract Year, the value assigned to the "Applicable Contract Year" would be "3" and the formula for calculating the DF for such LD Period would be: DF = 1- 0.005 * (3 -1).
However, because the MPR Assessment Period is a rolling 12-month period, the MPR Assessment Period will often straddle two consecutive Contract Years.
In such cases, all of the months falling within the same Contract Year will be assigned the value for such Contract Year and the value assigned to the "Applicable Contract Year" for purposes of the foregoing formula shall be the average of the assigned monthly values for such 12-month MPR Assessment Period.
For example, for an MPR Assessment Period which has four months in the third Contract Year and eight months in the fourth Contract Year, the value assigned to the "Applicable Contract Year" for such MPR Assessment Period would be 3.67, as calculated as follows:
(3X4) + (4X8) 12
and the formula for calculating the DF for such MPR Assessment Period would be DF= 1-0.005*(3.67-1).
For purposes of determining liquidated damages under this Section 2.6(c) (GPR Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages), the amount by which the Measured Performance Ratio for the MPR Assessment Period in question falls below the applicable threshold shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent (0.001).
Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (i) the damages that Company would incur if the Seller fails to achieve the EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

GPR Performance Metric for a MPR Assessment Period would be difficult or impossible to calculate with certainty and (ii) the aforesaid liquidated damages are an appropriate approximation of such damages.
EXAMPLE:
The following is an example calculation of liquidated damages for the GPR Performance Metric and is included for illustrative purposes only.
Assume the following facts:
The MPR Assessment Period has five months in the second Contract Year and seven months in the third Contract Year.
The GPR for the Facility as determined by the OEPR is 0.9.
The MPR has been calculated to be 0.694.
Applicable Contract Year = [(5 x 2) + (7 x 3)]/12 - 2.58
DF =1- 0.005 + (2.58 -1)= 0.9921
Upper limit of the Tier 1 bandwidth = 0.9 x 0.9921 x 0.95 = 0.848
Lower limit of the Tier 1 bandwidth/Upper limit of the Tier 2 bandwidth = 0.9 x 0.9921 x 0.9 = 0.804
Lower limit of the Tier 2 bandwidth = 0.8 x 0.9921 x 0.9
= 0.714
LD = [((0.848 - 0.804) x 1) + ((0.804 - 0.714) x 2) + ((0.714 - 0.694) x 4)] x MPR Assessment Period Lump Sum Payment = 0.304 x MPR Assessment Period Lump Sum Payment (d) MPR Termination Rights.
The Parties acknowledge that, although the intent of the liquidated damages payable under Section 2.6(c) (GPR Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages) is to compensate Company for the damages that Company would incur if the Seller fails to achieve the GPR Performance Metric for a MPR Assessment Period, such liquidated damages are not intended to compensate Company for the damages that Company would EXECUTION VERSION AES West Oahu Solar, LLC Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

Accordingly, and without limitation to Company's rights under said Section 2.6(c) (GPR Performance Metric and Liquidated Damages) for those MPR Assessment Periods during which the Seller failed to achieve the GPR Performance Metric, the failure of the PV System to achieve, for each of three consecutive Contract Years, a Measured Performance Ratio of not less than the Tier 2 Bandwidth for such Contract Year shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 15.1(c) of this Agreement for which Company shall have the rights (including but not limited to the termination rights) set forth in Article 15 (Events of Default) and Article 16 (Damages in the Event of Termination by Company).

For purposes of determining liquidated damages under this Section 2.7(a) (BESS Capacity Test and Liquidated Damages), the starting and end points for the duration of the period that the BESS discharges shall be rounded to the nearest MWh. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (i) the damages that Company would incur if the Seller fails to achieve the BESS Capacity Performance Metric for a BESS Measurement Period would be difficult or impossible to calculate with certainty and (ii) the aforesaid liquidated damages are an appropriate approximation of such damages.
EXAMPLE:
The following is an example calculation of liquidated damages for the BESS Capacity Performance Metric and is included for illustrative purposes only.
Assume the following:
The Maximum Rated Output for the BESS is 25 MW.
A BESS Capacity Test was conducted and the BESS was measured to have discharged 65 MWh BESS Contract Capacity = 25 MW x 4 hours = 100 MWh BESS Capacity Ratio = MWh Discharged/BESS Contract Capacity = 65 MWh/100 MWh = 0.65

The Parties acknowledge that, although the intent of the liquidated damages payable under Section 2.7(a) (BESS Capacity Test and Liquidated Damages) is to compensate Company for the damages that Company would incur if the BESS fails to demonstrate satisfaction of the BESS Capacity Performance Metric during a BESS Measurement Period, such liquidated damages are not intended to compensate Company for the damages that Company would incur if a pattern of underperformance establishes a reasonable expectation that the BESS is likely to continue to substantially underperform the Company's expectations.
Accordingly, and without limitation to Company's rights under said Section 2.7(a) (BESS Capacity Test and Liquidated Damages) for those BESS Measurement Periods during which the BESS fails to demonstrate satisfaction of the BESS Capacity Performance Metric, substantial underperformance shall give rise to a termination right as set forth in this Section 2.7(b) (BESS Capacity Test Termination Rights).
If the BESS is in the Lowest BESS Capacity Bandwidth for any two BESS Measurement Periods during a 12-month period, an 18-month cure period (the "BESS Capacity Cure Period") will commence on the Day following the close of the second such BESS Measurement Period.
For each BESS Measurement Period during such BESS Capacity Cure Period, BESS Capacity Tests shall continue to be conducted as set forth in Attachment W (BESS Capacity Test) and liquidated damages paid and accepted as set forth in Section 2.7(a) (BESS Capacity Test and Liquidated Damages); provided, however, that if the Seller fails to demonstrate satisfaction of the BESS Capacity Performance Metric prior to the expiration of the BESS Capacity Cure Period, such failure shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 15.1(d) of this Agreement for which Company shall have the rights (including but not limited to the termination rights) set forth in Article 15 (Events of Default) and Article 16 (Damages in the Event of Termination by Company).
