You are a pragmatic Solar M&A Senior Analyst in the United States. You are about to get instructions to extract information from documents. This information will be used to add meta data, create a summary and sort the documents.

Extract the following fields from the document text provided and format the response as valid JSON:
- "Document_date" in the format '3 letter month name-DD, YYYY'.
- "Document_summary" limited to a maximum of 3 sentences, tailored for a solar M&A analyst. It should state what kind of document it is, but also what its implicatoins are or what state it is in. It should assume the analyst knows about the M&A process.
- "Suggested_title" in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY max 5 word document title'. Try your best to come up with a title that is useful if you quickly want to understand what kind of document it is
- "Suggested_title_v2" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Suggested_title_v3" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Document_folder_path": Select the most suitable folder from the folder list which will be given. Follow instructions below. 
- "Document-label": "Communication", "Contract", "Amendment", "Technical Specification", "Application", "Exhibit",
- "Reasoning": Provide reasoning for every documents you classified. 

For "Document_folder_path", please follow these guidelines: 

    1. Do not create new folders. Documents must be classified based on existing categories, according to their primary content and purpose.

    2. Classify documents with precision, using these category definitions:

        "Interconnection": Contains contracts and agreements for connecting the solar project to the power grid. Look for phrases like "the interconnection customer agrees" and "interconnection requests".

        "Site Control": Includes legal documents that confirm the right to use, manage, and develop land for solar projects. This category is crucial for affirming legal authority over project sites and includes leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

        "PPA": Features power purchasing agreements between the project developer and an off-taker regarding the sale of generated solar power, detailing prices, terms, and standards, as well as supplementary documents.  

        "Environmental": Documents related to environmental impact assessments, permits, and compliance reports for the solar project. Includes studies on flora, fauna, water, soil, and air quality impacts, as well as mitigation strategies.

        "EPC": Contains contracts, plans, and documentation related to the engineering design, procurement of materials, and construction of the solar project. This includes agreements with contractors, project timelines, and construction permits.

    3. Prioritize document essence and main purpose for classification. In cases of uncertainty or documents that span multiple categories, classify according to the document's primary focus.
    4. Only classify documents as "Miscellaneous" if no other folder is likely. 
The list of to select folders from below:
  - Environmental
  - EPC
  - Interconnection
  - Permitting
  - PPA
  - Site Control
  - Miscellaneous

Objective The secondary and tertiary structure of an RNA molecule are crucial to its transcription of proteins, since they determine the reactivity of its individual nucleotides as contingent on whether they are paired or unpaired. Yet, directly measuring the structure of individual RNA molecules remains difficult, even with modern methods such as cryo-EM.
An intermediate step in this process is given by the selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension, or SHAPE, data associated with an RNA molecule. This measures the local reactivity of each nucleotide in the molecule with a certain reagent, and in turn informs the local flexibility of the RNA at a single-nucleotide resolution. SHAPE data is expected to completely encode tertiary structure, such that a perfect reconstruction of a molecule’s SHAPE data will allow for the computation of its tertiary structure. Given that experimental determination of tertiary structure via cryo-EM costs around $1,000 per molecule, whereas extraction of SHAPE data costs only $1 per molecule, using the segmented path of predicting SHAPE values and then structure could prove highly cost efficient.
The first step in this procedure, the task of accurately calculating the SHAPE values for a given sequence of nucleotides, remains largely open, and is what our research addresses. We aim to create a machine learning model that takes in only RNA nucleotide sequences as input, and outputs a vector containing the SHAPE value at each nucleotide. If done well, this model could very rapidly create a massive dataset of SHAPE data corresponding to RNA sequences, enabling the development of a new model that predicts tertiary structure from SHAPE profiles.

Related Work There is little existing work done on the task of predicting SHAPE data from RNA sequence. This is largely due to a historical lack of available SHAPE data, which thanks to a very recent release by Stanford’s Das Lab is no longer an issue. The one similar paper we found, Bliss et al. [2020] falls short in a number of ways. While the model architecture they used, a convolutional neural network with attention, is not necessarily bad, overall there is a lot left to be desired. Firstly, their model was trained on less than 250 RNA sequences and required 250 GB of RAM to train and 7 GB to run, which is an absurdly large and inefficient model for such limited data. The median correlation achieved was 0.5.

We have access to secondary structure information about each RNA sequence, reactivities with different reagents, and experimental error margins for the SHAPE values. We will be able to employ multitask and/or meta learning with our additional data types, leading to a more robust and accurate model. In conjunction with the Das Lab’s new and much larger dataset (4,000+ SHAPE profiles), our goal is to significantly improve prediction correlation with a significantly smaller model.

Technical Outline The core of our model will be a language model like an LSTM or transformer, which takes as input RNA sequences with a couple hundred nucleotides and predicts a SHAPE vector with a scalar value at each nucleotide index that indicates its local reactivity. This is analogous to creating an embedding for a string of text, a well-studied task. On top of this relatively straightforward task, we have a couple of options to incorporate auxiliary data.
Firstly, we have secondary structure data that indicates which nucleotides are bound to which other nucleotides. This gives us the option to employ multitask learning to inform the model with structural awareness. One possible method could be a multi-head network that predicts both SHAPE and secondary structure, causing the shared parameters of the model to additionally update according to secondary structure and hopefully improve the closely-related prediction of SHAPE values. Transfer learning is also an option, whereby a model that predicts binary nucleotide bind-
ings would first be trained, and then its weights used as a starting point for a SHAPE-predicting model.
We also have SHAPE data profiles as measured by nucleotide reactivity with different reagents.
This also lends itself to use in multitask and/or meta learning. A meta learning approach could be employed that treats SHAPE predictions for different reagents as different tasks, although there may not be enough tasks for this to be viable. Another multi-task method is definitely an option, likely one with shared parameters for much of the model, but different heads to predict SHAPE profiles for a fixed number of reagents. The goal of this endeavor is to improve model performance by including a higher quantity of more diverse data. It is also possible that this data could be aggregated and passed in to a more simple model.
Ultimately the novel contribution of our model will be the incorporation of additional data types through meta and multi-task learning, something which I don’t believe has been done in this context.
Our model will also be novel simply due to the novelty of the dataset.
