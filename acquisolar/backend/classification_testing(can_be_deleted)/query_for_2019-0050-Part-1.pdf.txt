BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I In the Matter of the Application of HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY INC.
, DOCKET NO.
2019-0050
For Approval of Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation with AES West Oahu Solar, LLC.
HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.'S APPLICATION TO THE HONORABLE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I:
By this Application, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. ("Hawaiian Electric" or the "Company") respectfully requests approval of a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation ('PPA" or "RDG PPA") executed by the Company and AES West Oahu Solar, LLC ('Seller") and other matters relating to the proposed 12.5-megawatt ("MW") photovoltaic system paired with a battery energy storage syxtern ("Project" or "Facility"). The Project will be located on University of Hawaii land north of the University of Hawaii - West Oahu campus and the H-1 freeway near the Kualakai Parkway, on the island of O'ahu.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The PPA is a product of the Company's Stage 1 Requext for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation ("RFP") and includes the renewable dispatchable generation ("RDG") contracting mechanism, which is a contractual vehicle to allow for better utilization of the Project's renewable resource by Hawaiian Electric and improves on the Company' s ability to plan for future renewable resources, while mitigating the financial risk associated with curtailment for Seller. Subject to the limitations of the renewable solar resource, the PPA gives Hawaiian Electric the contractual flexibility to dispatch the Facility (both generation and storage). In exchange, the Seller is provided a monthly payment ("Lump Sum Payment") which is subject to potential offset for liquidated damages based on the availability and performance ofthe Facility.
Hawaiian Electric's previous as-available PPAs required that the energy produced by the associated facility be accepted by the Company regardless of cost, based on the seniority of the project, so long as the system is able to accept the energy. This practice limited the contribution from the renewable resources to the grid operations and the Company's ability to plan for subsequent renewable opportunities. In contrast, the PPA enables Hawaiian Electric to optimize the use and usability of the Facility to meet the system's energy and grid service requirements.
This is critically important over the 25-year term of the PPA due to the dynamic nature of the grid as Hawai'i progresses toward its goal of 100% renewables by 2045.
Hawaiian Electric proposes to enter into a PPA with Seller for the proposed Project capable of generating up to 27,571 megawatt-hours ("MWh") per year. The Project's photovoltaic system and battery energy storage system together will provide the Company with flexible, dispatchable renewable energy. The Facility as a whole will provide grid services and additional capacity to the Hawaiian Electric system. In particular, the storage capability ofthe Facility will allow the Company to shift the delivery to the grid of the energy generated by the Facility to times when the need is greater.
Hawaiian Electric respectfully submits that the PPA is reasonable and in the public interest, and should be approved, as:
2-
(a) Both the PPA and Project are consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP Update Report: December 2016,1 and the Commission's Inclinations;2
(b) The Project was selected through a competitive procurement process that has resulted in a reasonable Lump Sum Payment price for the PPA;
(c) The Proj ect is not expected to increase curtailment of existing as-available renewable resources or impede consideration of additional renewable resources to Hawaiian Electric's system;
(d) The Project will help to meet the State of Hawai'i's ("State") energy policy objectives and Renewable Portfolio Standards ("RPS") goals as well as contribute to the State's goal of greater energy security and energy self-sufficiency; and (e) The PPA incorporates the recently-developed RDG contracting mechanism that will improve on the Company's ability to plan for this and subsequent renewable resources.3
I. REOUESTED APPROVALS Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission issue two decisions and orders as follows:

VI.
JUSTIFICATION Approval ofthe Project and PPA is reasonable, as:
(a) The Project was selected as a result of a competitive procurement process, as further described in Exhibit 2.
(b) The Project is advantageous due to the ability to dispatch the Facility. Hawaiian Electric will be able to dispatch energy from the Project's photovoltaic system or stored energy from the battery energy storage system as needed (rather than only relying on conventional generation units), offset night-time customer demand, and assist in grid stabilization subject to discharge limits. As shown in Exhibit 3, the Facility is anticipated to have a substantial positive impact by decreasing Hawaiian Electric's future dispatch of oil-fueled units.
(c) The PPA was based on the model PPA for Renewable Dispatchable Generation filed with the RFP and revised in consultation with the Independent Observerss prior to issuing the final RFP. Specific terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the Company and Seller at arms-length and contain indemnification, insurance, and other provisions that will serve to protect the Company and its customers from certain risks associated with interconnection with the Facility. Hawaiian Electric negotiated significant provisions to assess the Facility's availability and performance throughout the term to ensure the Facility's capabilities at any time it is dispatched during the term, as further discussed in Exhibit 4.
8 See Docket No. 03-0372, Competitive Bidding for New Generation, filed June 15, 2007 and accepted by Commission in D&O 23614, filed August 28,2007, at Exhibit A, page 2: "Independent Observer - The neutral person or entity retained by the electric utility to monitor the utility's competitive bidding process, and to advise the utility and Commission on matters arising out of the competitive bidding process, as described in Part III.C of the Framework." 7-
(d) The Unit Price, as defined in the PPA, is advantageous in that it is fixed for the duration of the PPA and anticipated to result in lower effective rates for customers.
(e) It is anticipated that the Project will provide bill savings to customers over the Term ofthe PPA, as further discussed in Exhibit 3.
(if) In addition to this Project, the Company has filed other applications to approve PPAs for this island under the competitive bidding process to acquire dispatchable and renewable generation established in docket No. 2017-0352. Considering the totality ofthese projects procured under the competitive bidding process, the Company believes that approving all of these competitive bidding projects is consistent with the public interest. The savings to customers across all proposed projects for the island is greater than the savings for any individual proj ect, as further discussed in Exhibit 3.
(g) The Project will reduce Hawaiian Electric's fuel consumption and result in a reduction of GHG emissions, as further discussed in Exhibit 3 and Exhibit 5.
(h) The renewable energy to be dispatched from the Facility pursuant to the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the State of Hawai'i's RPS goals. As shown in Exhibit 6, Hawaiian Electric estimates that the Facility will contribute approximately 0.4% to Hawaiian Electric's 2022 RPS.
(i) The right to dispatch the Facility under the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the goal set forth in Hawaiian Electric's PSIP' to move towards energy independence and decreased reliance on foreign imported oil while maintaining reliability of the Company's system.
See Docket No. 2014-0183, The Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP Update Report, filed December 23, 2016 and accepted by Commission in D&O 34696, filed July 14, 2017, at ES-2.

VIL BACKGROUND This Project is the result ofthe Company's RFP for Variable Renewable Generation.
By letter dated June 6, 2016, Hawaiian Electric requested that the Commission open a docket to allow the Company to solicit proposals for new renewable energy generation. The Commission subsequently issued Order No. 34856 and opened Docket 2017-0352 to receive filings, review approval requests, and resolve disputes, if necessary, related to the Hawaiian Electric Companies' plan to proceed with competitive procurement of dispatchable firm generation and new renewable energy generation. On February 20, 2018, the Commission approved the Company's RFP, which was issued on February 27,2018. Exhibit 2 provides a detailed summary ofthe RFP process.
The Project is consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP which set forth the Companies' intention to competitively procure new grid-scale generation resources through detailed plans and actions for the years 2017 to 2021.10
Further the Project is consistent with the State's energy policy, which encourages the use and development of renewable energy.11 Moreover, the Project will help Hawaiian Electric meet the State's energy policy goals by reducing Hawaiian Electric's reliance on fossil fuels and implementing additional renewable energy resources. Based on the analysis set forth in Exhibit 1 it is estimated that the renewable energy supplied by the Project may save Hawaiian Electric up to 545,794 barrels of fuel and 64 tons of coal over the term of the PPA based on a forecasted fuel consumption reduction.12 The State's overall energy objectives are set forth in HRS  226-
10 See ii at ES-1
11 See Title 15, Chapter 269, Part V, HRS.
12 See Exhibit 3, Attachment 3.
9-
18(a), which states, in relevant part:
(a) Planning for the State's facility systems with regard to energy shall be directed toward the achievement ofthe following obj ectives, giving due consideration to all:
(1) Dependable, efficient, and economical statewide energy systems capable of supporting the needs of the people;
(2) Increased energy self-sufficiency where the ratio of indigenous to imported energy use is increased;
(3) Greater energy security and diversification in the face of threats to Hawaii's energy supplies and systems; and (4) Reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply and use.
The objectives in the area of renewable energy are to promote commercialization of Hawai'i's sustainable energy resources and technologies to reduce the State's high dependence on imported oil, increase local economic development, and reduce the potential negative economic impacts of oil price fluctuations.
Moreover, HRS  269-6(b) requires that the Commission:
[Clonsider the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels through energy efficiency and increased renewable energy generation in exercising its authority and duties under this chapter.
In making determinations ofthe reasonableness ofthe costs ofutility system capital improvements and operations, the [Clommission shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions. The [Clomission may determine that short-term costs or direct costs that are higher than alternatives relying more heavily on fossil fuels are reasonable, considering the impacts resulting from the use offossil fuels.
Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission explicitly take into consideration the avoidance of production oftens ofthousands oftons of GHG emissions each 10-
year, for an estimated total of 244,394 tons of GHG emissions that will be avoided during the 25-
year term ofthe PPA. 13
In support of these objectives, Hawai'i's RPS law was established by the State Legislature in 2001, and amended in 2006, 2009 and 2015. Pursuant to HRS  269-92(a), each electric utility company14 that sells electricity for consumption in Hawai'i is required by law to establish a RPS of: (a) 10% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2010; (b) 15% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2015; (c) 30% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2020; (d) 40% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2030; (e) 70% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2040; and (if) 100% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2045. In addition, HRS  269-92(b)(1) requires that after December 31, 2014, the entire RPS be met by electrical energy generated using renewable energy sources, and HRS 269-92(b)(2) requires that beginning January 1,2015, electrical energy savings shall not count toward the RPS. The Project will assist Hawaiian Electric in satisfying these RPS goals, as further shown in Exhibit 6.
Accordingly, Commission approval ofthe PPA for the Project: (1) will give Hawaiian Electric the opportunity to contribute to its renewable energy portfolio on average 0.5% per year over the 25-year term ofthe PPA and contribute to the Companies' consolidated RPS on average 0.4% per year;15 (2) is consistent with the State's energy policy encouraging the use and development of renewable energy resources; (3) advances the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels and the reduction of GHG emissions as articulated in HRS  269-6(b); and (4) promotes the State's overall energy objectives set forth in HRS  226-18(a).
13 See Exhibit 5.
14 Pursuant to HRS  269-93, "[aln electric utility company and its electric utility affiliates may aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve the [RPS]." 13 See Exhibit 6.

VIII. PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Description of Developer Seller is a Delaware limited liability company in good standing and is a wholly owned subsidiary of AES Distributed Energy, Inc. which has its principal place of business at 4875
Pearl East Circle, Suite 200, Boulder, CO 80301. AES Distributed Energy, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of The AES Corporation. The ownership structure of Seller is attached in Exhibit A-2 to the PPA. Seller has filed appropriate documentation to register as a foreign limited liability company with the Hawai'i Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and will provide a copy of its Hawaii certificate of good standing to Company shortly after filing.
AES Distributed Energy is a leader in solar and solar plus battery energy storage system deployment. AES Distributed Energy has over 200 MW of operating solar projects and over 300
MW in development or under construction throughout the U. S. AES Distributed Energy placed in service before the end of year 2018 the largest solar plus battery energy storage project in Hawai'i - a 28 MW solar plus 100 MWh battery energy storage project on the Island of Kauai.
Additionally, AES Distributed Energy has a second project under construction on Kauai-a 19
MW solar plus 70 MWh battery energy storage--and several smaller solar projects on Oahu.
The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) is a Fortune 500 Global Power Company which provides affordable, sustainable energy to 15 countries through a diverse portfolio of distribution business as well as thermal and renewable generation facilities. Revenues in 2017 were $11
billion and The AES Corporation owns and manages $33 billion in total assets.
B. Site and Facility Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller will construct a solar photovoltaic system plus battery energy storage system comprised of 17.5 MWdc of solar photovoltaic panels mounted at a fixed tilt. The Facility will contain a 12.5 MWac / 50MWh battery energy storage system 12-
consisting of twenty (20) 650kW lithium-ion battery containers that will connect directly to the photovoltaic component of the Facility. The battery energy storage system will charge from energy collected by the photovoltaic system portion of the Facility. The solar photovoltaic panels and the battery energy storage system will be connected on the DC side and will feed into five (5) 2.8 MWac shared central inverters for a total maximum system output of 12.5 MWac.
The Facility will be capable of generating power used by an estimated 4,600 homes.
The equipment installed at the Facility (including the inverters) will meet the Company requirements set forth in the PPA. The Allowed Capacity for the Facility is limited to 12.5 MW.
The Facility will interconnect to Hawaiian Electric's existing Ewa Nui 42 46 kV transmission line running through the site.
Seller will build, own and operate the proposed Facility, in parallel with Hawaiian Electric's system according to the terms of the PPA. Seller is responsible for and will obtain the necessary Governmental Approvals for the construction of the Facility pursuant to the terms of the PPA. The Facility will be located on University of Hawaii land north of the University of Hawaii - West Oahu campus and the H-1 freeway near the Kualakai Parkway on approximately 80 acres of agricultural land and includes LSB soil classifications B, D and E within Tax Map Key No. 1-9-2-002-007. A map showing the general location ofthe Project site is attached as Exhibit 7.
Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller is responsible to construct16 and own, a proposed renewable energy facility, including all Seller-owned interconnection facilities and all other equipment, devices, and associated appurtenances owned, controlled, operated, and managed by 16 Seller, as a developer of renewable energy systems, intends to hire a properly licensed contractor to build the proposed renewable energy facility that is classified as an eligible resource under Hawai'Fs RPS Law, HRS  269-
91 through 269-95. See PPA at 1.
13-
Seller in connection with, or to facilitate, the production, generation, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of electric energy by Seller to Hawaiian Electric, in parallel with Hawaiian Electric's system. Electric energy produced by the Facility will be provided by Seller to Hawaiian Electric and delivered to the Point of Interconnection in response to Company dispatch of the Facility.
Seller represents and warrants that, as ofthe Commercial Operations Date ("COD") of the Facility, the Facility will be a qualified renewable resource under the RPS in effect as ofthe effective date ofthe PPA ("Effective Date").17 Accordingly, based on Seller's representation and warranty, any and all energy delivered by Seller to Hawaiian Electric from or through the Facility throughout the term of the PPA will meet the definition of"renewable electrical energy" or "renewable energy" as defined under HRS  269-91 as of the Effective Date.
The key benefit of the Facility, contracted through the RDG PPA, is that the Company will be able to utilize attributes ofthe Facility to best meet the needs of the Company's system.
Having the photovoltaic system paired with a battery energy storage system adds significant value to the Facility by allowing the energy produced during the day that cannot be readily accepted by the Company to be stored and dispatched to the Company's system at future times of higher customer demand, which is more beneficial to the Company's system than past projects that required instantaneous use of energy produced. Hawaiian Electric anticipates that it will dispatch the battery energy storage system's stored energy to the Hawaiian Electric grid to, among other things, help with ramping towards Hawaiian Electric's periods of peak energy demand (rather than ramping up conventional generation), offset night time fossil fuel generation, and assist in grid stabilization subject to discharge limits. See Exhibit 3, Attachment 5 for the representative dispatch of the Project.
17 See PPA at  22.2(ID and preamble.
14-
Whether the full Lump Sum Payment per period is subject to offset for liquidated damages is contingent on the Facility meeting specific Performance Metrics as outlined in the PPA. If the Facility's photovoltaic system fails to satisfy one or more of the thresholds as stated in the Performance Metrics, liquidated damages will be assessed based on the full Lump Sum Payment amount. Liquidated damages tied directly to the capacity ofthe battery energy storage system will be assessed based on the BESS Allocated Portion ofthe Lump Sum Payment, which is a percentage ofthe full Lump Sum Payment. The liquidated damages have the potential to reduce the Lump Sum Payment down to zero if the Facility is completely unavailable or if the Facility is available but underperforming in other aspects as measured by the Performance Metrics. See Exhibit 4 for the PPA Performance Metrics and Liquidated Damages Assessment.
IX.
INTERCONNECTION The Facility will interconnect to the Company's existing Ewa Nui 42 46 kV circuit. An IRS will be conducted to evaluate the effects ofthe proposed interconnection of the Facility to the Company system. Upon completion ofthe IRS for the Project and execution by the Parties of an Interconnection Requirements Amendment, which will include a preliminary single-line diagram, relay list, relay settings, and trip scheme ofthe Facility as described in Attachment E (Single-Line Drawing) and Attachment F (Relay List and Trip Scheme) of the PPA, the Company will submit the Interconnection Requirements Amendment with the Commission in a subsequent informational filing. A final single-line drawing, relay list, and trip scheme ofthe Facility will then be attached to the PPA and made a part thereof on the COD. After the COD, no changes can be made to the final single-line diagram, relay list, or trip scheme without the prior written consent of Seller and the Company.
To take advantage of favorable pricing under the PPA due to the availability of federal investment tax credits that begin to phase out in 2019, and are scheduled to expire in 2022, the 15-
Parties agreed to execute the PPA prior to the completion of the IRS for the Project. 18 Following completion ofthe IRS (including the completion by the Company ofthe Total Estimated Interconnection Costs and project schedule), the Parties will execute an Interconnection Requirements Amendment, substituting new versions of Attachment B (Facility Owned by Seller), Attachment E (Single-Line Drawings), Attachment F (Relay List and Trip Scheme), Attachment G (Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities), Attachment K (Guaranteed Project Milestones), Attachment L (Reporting Milestones), and Attachment N (Acceptance Test General Criteria) to reflect the results of the IRS.19 Under Section 12.4(b) of the PPA, if Seller is dissatisfied with the results ofthe IRS (because, for example, of the technical requirements imposed or the cost of the interconnection work), it has the option, by written notice delivered to the Company no later than the Termination Deadline,20 to declare the PPA null and void.
Notably, the PPA does not allow for any adjustment to pricing upon completion ofthe IRS and interconnection cost estimates.
X. PPA TERMS AND CONDITIONS The terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the Parties at arms-length, over the time period set by the Commission. The PPA contains commercial and technical terms that are fair to both parties while also serving to protect Hawaiian Electric and its customers from certain risks associated with the Seller's development, interconnection and operation of the Facility. Moreover, the terms and conditions of the PPA will not affect the Company's ability to 18 See PPA  12.4.
19 See PPA  12.4(a) 20 As defined in the PPA, "Termination Deadline" means the 30th day following the date the completed IRS (including the Total Estimated Interconnection Costs and project schedule completed by Company) is provided to Seller, or such later date as Company and Seller may agree to by a written agreement.
16-
provide electric service to its customers and are not discriminatory to other small power producers. Hawaiian Electric maintains that, for these reasons, the Commission find that the purchased power arrangements (i.e., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric purchases energy from Seller, are prudent and in the public interest.
Pursuant to Article 12.3(b) of the PPA, Seller shall seek participation without intervention in this docket for the limited purpose and only to the extent necessary to assist the Commission in making an informed decision regarding the approval ofthe PPA. The scope of Seller's participation shall be determined by the Commission.
A detailed summary and discussion ofthe key terms and conditions ofthe RDG PPA is set forth in the document entitled "Key PPA Terms and Conditions", attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 4.
XI.
COMMUNITY OUTREACH Pursuant to the community outreach requirements set forth in the RFP, Seller was required to conduct a public meeting in the community where the proposed Project is located.
The intent of the meeting was to gather stakeholders and other interested parties in the area to apprise the community about the Project, and to allow an opportunity for community concerns and questions to be raised. The Parties negotiated Section 29.21 of the PPA detailing the Seller's community outreach obligations during the entire development period, which include soliciting written community comments, and submitting all received written community comments as part of this Application.21 Attached hereto as Exhibit 8 are copies of initial public comments from Seller's community outreach efforts, as well a summary of Seller's community outreach efforts made to date; however, as Seller's community meeting was only just recently convened on 21 See PPA at  29.21.
17-
Tuesday, February 26, 2019, at Kapolei High School, the Company intends to update the record with any additional public comments received by the Company or Seller within 30 days ofthe aforementioned community meeting.
XIL ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation,22 addresses variable interest entities ("VIE") and primary beneficiaries (entities that consolidate VIEs). FASB ASC 810 could potentially require that the purchaser under a PPA, such as Hawaiian Electric, consolidate the seller, such as AES West Oahu Solar, LLC. Ifthe PPA is determined to constitute a variable interest in Seller and that Hawaiian Electric is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then Hawaiian Electric will be required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements. Consolidating Seller onto Hawaiian Electric's financial statements will have uncertain impacts on the assessments of investors and/or credit rating agencies on the risks associated with this PPA and Hawaiian Electric's creditworthiness. In addition, if Hawaiian Electric is required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements, then Hawaiian Electric's management will be required to assess the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting, in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Hawaiian Electric is unwilling to be subject to accounting treatment that results from VIE treatment as set forth in FASB ASC 810.23
22 Formerly FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, "Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46R." Effective July 1, 2009, all various Generally Accepted Accounting Principles issued by FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), etc. (with the exception of the Securities Exchange Commission) have been codified into a single source of authoritative guidance. For purposes of this Application, included is the new codification reference, as well as the original standard reference for ease of review. See "Summary of Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003)" filed in Docket No. 04-0113, Hawaiian Electric's 2005 test year rate case, HECO-2114 for additional information on this accounting guidance.

A preliminary consolidation evaluation ofthe PPA and Seller was performed under FASB ASC 810, and it appears consolidation is not required. An evaluation will be performed when Commission approval of the PPA is received. Thereafter, FASB ASC 810 requires Hawaiian Electric to continuously reassess its evaluation on an on-going basis.
A. Lease Accounting FASB ASC 842, Leases,24 specifies tests to be applied to an arrangement, in this case, the PPA, to determine: (1) whether or not the arrangement contains a lease and specifies the circumstances under which an arrangement should be evaluated to determine whether or not it contains a lease; and (2) if it is deemed a lease, whether it is an operating or finance lease.
If the PPA is deemed a lease, it will be classified as either an operating or a finance lease.
If it is deemed an operating lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset, lease obligation and lease expense. If the PPA is deemed a finance lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset, lease obligation and related interest and amortization expense.
A preliminary evaluation of the PPA was performed under FASB ASC 842, and it appears that the PPA does not contain a lease. FASB ASC 842 also specifies certain conditions when Hawaiian Electric must re-assess whether lease accounting treatment is required.
Hawaiian Electric will re-perform this analysis when Commission approval is received.
Thereafter, an evaluation will be performed ifthere are modifications to the PPA.
B. Impact of Imputed Debt on Credit Oualitv The payments Hawaiian Electric is required to make under this PPA are for availability and performance of Renewable Dispatchable Generation as set forth in the PPA. While there is no recorded liability for the long-term lease expense payments, credit rating agencies would 24 The PPA was evaluated under ASC 842, which became effective on January 1, 2019, superseding ASC 840, Leases.

reflect these obligations as imputed debt in the ratios used to evaluate Hawaiian Electric's risk profile. On May 7,2007, Standard & Poor's ("S&P") published an article titled "Standard & Poor's Methodology For Imputing Debt For U. S. Utilities' Power Purchase Agreements" ("S&P's 5-7-07 Article"). In this article, S&P imputes debt for fixed PPA obligations and includes this imputed debt in its analysis of a company's financial metrics.
New lease accounting rules effective January 1, 2019 will require all leases with terms greater than twelve months to be included on the balance sheet. On April 16,2018, S&P published a Credit FAQ titled "What Do New Lease Accounting Changes Mean For Corporate Credit Ratings?" ("S&P's 4-16-18 Article"). In this article, S&P states:
[Florthcoming changes to lease accounting within international and U.S. accounting standards that come into force from 2019 will generally not affect S&P Global Ratings' view of the creditworthiness of companies it rates, because nothing will be changing about the underlying credit fundamentals ofthese companies. That said, the Company has not ruled out the possibility that, in certain cases, the new financial reporting might highlight new information that we will need to factor into our analysis. Yet, although some components of certain individual credit ratings might change, we expect the overall effect to be limited" 25
For companies that follow U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S.
GAAP"), S&P expects to continue applying the current methodology for operating leases.26
25 S&]?'s 4-16-18 Article at 1.
26 In this regard, S&]?'s 4-16-18 Article at 4 states:
Under our current methodology for operating leases, the lease-related expense is allocated to interest and depreciation. Interest expense is increased by the product of the 7% standard discount rate we currently use, multiplied by the average net present value of the lease payments for the current and previous years. Additionally, our EBITDA calculation increases because we add back in the interest and depreciation. We expect to continue applying this approach for companies that follow U. S. (MAP.

Hawaiian Electric prepared estimates ofthe imputed debt and rebalancing costs based on S&P's methodology as described above. Imputed debt at inception is estimated to be approximately$8,417,000, with annual rebalancing costs estimated at approximately $402,000.
XIII. AUTHORITY FOR REOUESTED APPROVALS A. PPA Approval This Application is filed pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure Before the Public Utilities Commission ofthe State of Hawai'i, Title 6, Chapter 61, ofthe HAR.
Commission approval of this PPA and Lump Sum Payments is sought pursuant to HRS  269-
27.2 and HAR Chapter 6-74, which generally guide the Commission's review ofthe rates agreed upon between Hawaiian Electric and Seller. Specifically, HRS  269-27.2(c) provides, in relevant part:
The rate payable by the public utility to the producer for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility shall be as agreed between the public utility and the supplier and as approved by the public utilities commission; provided that in the event the public utility and the supplier fail to reach an agreement for a rate, the rate shall be as prescribed by the public utilities commission according to the powers and procedures provided in this chapter.
The commission's determination of the just and reasonable rate shall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels and the rate for the non-fossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost savings resulting from the use of non-fossil fuel generated electricity.
As the commission deems appropriate, the just and reasonable rate for non-fossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility by the producer may include mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments, such as adjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or other acceptable adjustment mechanisms.
HAR  6-74-22(a) also provides that the rates for purchase shall:
(1) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer ofthe electric utility and in the public interest;
21-
(2) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities; and (3) Be not less than one hundred per cent of avoided cost for energy and capacity purchases to be determined as provided in [HAR ] 6-74-23 from qualifying facilities and not less than the minimum purchase rate.27
As such, Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests (i) approval for the PPA, (ii) a finding that the purchased power arrangements under the PPA are prudent and in the public interest; and (iii) a finding that the Lump Sum Payment to be paid pursuant to the PPA is just and reasonable based on the following support:
1. Through the RFP process, the Project was competitively procured based on both price and non-price factors.
2. An important feature ofthe Project is that the battery energy storage system has the ability to store energy that cannot be readily accepted by the grid as it is produced. This would allow for dispatch of time-shifted energy to higher customer demand.
3. The Project is anticipated to provide savings to the typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer. It is estimated that as a result of this Project, a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer consuming 500 kWh could save approximately $0.22 per month in 2022 and $0.40 per month in 2023 on the customer's electric bills.28
4. As further discussed in Exhibit 3 to this Application, the Project will significantly reduce fuel consumption of Hawaiian Electric's conventional generating units. It is 27 Notwithstanding, HAR  6-74-15(b)(1) states that nothing in HAR Title 6, Chapter 74, Subchapter 3 (i.e., HAR  6-74-15 to 28) "[p]rohibits an electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subchapter[.]]Ä 28 The projected bill impact calculation is only intended to provide an illustrative example of potential customer bill savings. The specific assumptions and results used in the bill impact calculations are provided in the evaluation attached hereto as Exhibit 3.
22-
estimated that the Project would displace approximately 545,794 barrels of fuel and 64 tons of coal over the term ofthe PPA.
5. This project will assist Hawaiian Electric in meeting its RPS goals. The Project is anticipated to contribute 0.4% toward Hawaiian Electric's 2022 RPS goal.
6. The terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the parties at arm's-length, over a period of approximately four months.
B. Purchased Power Adiustment Clause The total Lump Sum Payments, as defined in the PPA, are payments made by Company to Seller in exchange for Seller making the Net Energy Potential29 ofthe Facility available for dispatch by Company.30 The amount of energy delivered by Facility to Company is not a factor in calculating the Lump Sum Payment for any given period. Using the availability ofthe Facility and its Net Energy Potential as a basis for Lump Sum Payments limits the developer's financial risk associated with excess energy curtailment, as seen in PPAs for prior projects, while at the same time ensuring low-cost pricing to benefit customers for the term of the PPA.
Consequently, Commission authorization is requested to include the total Lump Sum Payments that are incurred by Hawaiian Electric through the Company's PPAC, as may be applicable, to the extent such costs are not included in base rates.
C. HRS  269-27.6 - 46 kV Transmission Line Subject to completion ofthe IRS for the Project, and the filing of the Interconnection Requirements Amendment based on the IRS results, Hawaiian Electric will request a 29 See PPA, Attachment U  1(a) 3 See PPA, "Schedule of Defined Terms" for definition of Lump Sum Payment.
23-
Commission determination for construction of the proposed 46 kV line extension pursuant to HRS  269-27.6(a), which provides that:
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, whenever a public utility applies to the public utilities commission for approval to place, construct, erect, or otherwise build a new 46 kilovolt or greater high voltage electric transmission system, either above or below the surface ofthe ground, the public utilities commission shall determine whether the electric transmission system shall be placed, constructed, erected, or built above or below the surface ofthe ground; provided that in its determination, the public utilities commission shall consider:
(1) Whether a benefit exists that outweighs the costs of placing the electric transmission system underground;
(2) Whether there is a governmental public policy requiring the electric transmission system to be placed, constructed, erected or built underground and the governmental agency establishing the policy commits funds for the additional costs of undergrounding;
(3) Whether any governmental agency or other parties are willing to pay for the additional costs of undergrounding;
(4) The recommendation ofthe division of consumer advocacy ofthe department of commerce and consumer affairs, which shall be based on an evaluation of the factors set forth under this subsection; and (5) Any other relevant factors.
Subsections (b) and (c) of HRS  269-27.6, which apply to 138 kV and greater lines, do not apply to this Proj ect.
D. HRS  269-27.5 - Public Hearing Subject to completion ofthe IRS for the Project, and the filing of the Interconnection Requirements Amendment based on the IRS results, ifthe proposed 46 kV overhead line extension, if applicable, will run through any residential area, Hawaiian Electric will request that the Commission conduct a public hearing, if necessary, under HRS  269-27.5, which provides:
Whenever a public utility plans to place, construct, erect, or otherwise build a new 46 kilovolt or greater high-voltage electric transmission system above the surface of the ground through any residential area, the public utilities commission shall conduct a public hearing prior to its issuance of approval thereof. Notice of 24-
the hearing shall be given in the manner provided in section 269-16
for notice of public hearings.
XIV.
CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission issue two decisions and orders as follows:
1. First Decision and Order Request: Approval of Power Purchase Agreement (a) Approve the PPA, by and between Hawaiian Electric and Seller, for the Project, as further described above and attached hereto as Exhibit 1, (b) Find that the purchased power arrangements under the PPA, pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric will dispatch energy on an availability basis from Seller and the Lump Sum Payments paid to Seller, are prudent and in the public interest with explicit consideration, if required by law under HRS  269-6, ofthe effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and GHG emissions;
(c) Authorize Hawaiian Electric to include all non-energy payments under the PPA, including the Lump Sum Payment (as defined in the PPA), and related revenue taxes, through the PPAC, to the extent such costs are not included in base rates; and (d) Grant such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the circumstances.
Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission issue this decision and order as soon as practicable in order to help facilitate the implementation of this low cost renewable energy project, and its attainment of tax credits, which is expected to reduce the cost of electricity to benefit customers, as further described herein.
25-
2. Second Decision and Order Request: Approval of Above-Ground 46 kV Line Extension Upon completion of an IRS for the Project, the informational filing of an Interconnection Requirements Amendment,31 and the filing of such additional information as may be necessary in connection with the requested approval of the above-ground 46 kV line extension, that the Commission issue a decision and order that:
(a) If necessary, determines that a 46 kV line extension that is included as part of Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities may be constructed above the surface of the ground, pursuant to HRS  269-27.6(a);
(b) If necessary, requires a public hearing pursuant to HRS  269-27.5; and (c) Grants such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the circumstances.
