INC.
For Approval of Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation with BCE Kupono Solar, LLC.
HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.'S APPLICATION TO THE HONO1UBLE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I:
By this Application, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. ("Hawaiian Electric" or the "Company") seeks approval of a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation and the First Amendment to Power Purchase Agreement For Renewable Dispatchable Generation (PV + BESS) (collectively the "PPA" or "RDG PPA") executed by the Company and BCE Kupono Solar, LLC ("Seller") and other matters relating to Seller's proposed 42-megawatt ("MW") photovoltaic project paired with energy storage ("Project" or "Facility' 3.
The Project will be located in Ewa, on the island of O'ahu. Pursuant to the Commission's guidance regarding the accelerated timeline for the Hawaiian Electric Companies' Stage 2
Request for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation and Energy Storage C'Stage 2 RFP'), approval of the PPA is sought by early to mid 2022.1
1 See Docket No. 2017-0352, Order No. 36604, issued on October 9, 2019, at 25: "The commission has repeatedly expressed that timely execution ofthe competitive procurement process is a central objective oftbis proceedmg." EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The PPA is a product of the Company's Stage 2 RFP and is based on the renewable dispatchable generation contracting mechanism, which allows for better utilization of the Project's renewable resource by Hawaiian Electric and facilitates the increasing contribution from new renewable resources, while mitigating the financial risk associated with curtailment for Seller. The PPA gives Hawaiian Electric dispatch rights over the renewable energy facilities (both generation and storage). In exchange, the Seller is provided a fixed monthly payment C'Lump Sum Payment"), which is subject to adjustment based on the availability and performance of the Facility.
Hawaiian Electric's previous as-available power purchase agreements required that the energy produced by the associated facility be accepted by the Company based on the seniority of the project. This practice limited the ability to move to 100% renewable energy, as the contribution from newerrenewable resources was necessarily less than older resources, and the energy-only compensation limited the ability to use resources for grid services such as operating reserves, or to operate each facility on the basis of overall benefit to grid operations. The energy-only contracts therefore hindered the Company's ability to increase renewable energy opportunities. In contrast, the RDG PPA enables Hawaiian Electric to use the facility to meet the system's energy and grid service requirements. This flexibility is critically important over the 20-year term of the PPA as Hawai'i progresses toward its goal of 100% renewables by 2045.
Hawaiian Electric has entered into a PPA with Seller for the proposed Project, which Seller represents will be capable of generating up to 93,287 MWhper year. The Project's solar photovoltaic ('TV") and storage components together will provide the Company with flexible, semi-dispatchable renewable energy. The Facility as a whole will provide grid services and 2-
energy to the Hawaiian Electric system. In particular, the storage capability of the Facility will allow the Company to store solar energy generated by the Facility to be delivered during times of available demand. When grid-charging is permitted, the Company will also be able to store energy from other resources on the grid to allow for greater certainty of supply for periods of lower solar production.
As discussed in more detail herein, Hawaiian Electric respectfully submits that the PPA is reasonable and in the public interest and should be approved for the following reasons:
(a) Both the PPA and Project are consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies'2
PSIP Update Report: December 2016,3 and the Commission's Inclinations;4
(b) The Project was selected through a competitive procurement process approved by the Commission and overseen by the Independent Observer, consistent with the Commission's Framework for Competitive Bidding.5 This process allowed the Company to choose a portfolio of projects, including this Project, to provide the contemplated benefits the Company was seeking as part of the Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu with competitive pricing;
(c) The Unit Price, as defined in the PPA, is advantageous in that it is fixed for the duration of the PPA and is based upon the renewable dispatchable generation contracting 2 The "Hawaiian Electric Companies" or"Companies" are Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.

mechanism that will improve on the Company's ability to leverage maximum value from this and subsequent renewable resources,6
(d) Fossil fuel prices are volatile. The PPA will reduce customer exposure to fuel price volatility by adding renewable generation at a fixed price, which will result in reduced fossil fuel consumption;
(e) The Project is not expected to increase curtailment of existing as-available renewable resources or impede consideration of additional renewable resources to Hawaiian Electric's system;
(f) The Project will help to meet the State ofHawai'i's energy policy objectives and Renewable Portfolio Standards C'RPS") goals. The Facility is expected to increase Hawaiian Electric's 2025 RPS by up to 1.23 percentage points, and increase the Hawaiian Electric Companies' consolidated 2025 RPS by up to 0.94 percentage points, thus contributing to the state's goal ofgreater energy security and energy self-sufficiency;7
(g) The Facility provides essential Grid Services as defined in the Integrated Grid Planning process as well as providing grid forming capability and the allowance to use the battery for grid-charging pursuant to the terms of the PPA; and (h) As further discussed in Exhibit 3 to this Application, according to the modeling conducted, the Facility will reduce fossil fuel consumption by Hawaiian Electric's generating units. It is estimated from these results that the Facility has the potential to displace about 6 See Docket No. 2014-0183, D&O 34696, at 3: "The commission expects the Companies to continuously improve and refine their resource planning tools and methods, and employ these tools to support appropriate competitive procurement processes and project applications in the near term." 7 The RPS calculations are based on the fossil fuel displacement identified in Exhibit 3 to this Application. Time may be required to prove the capabilities ofthe Facility as the operation ofthe systems displaces conventional plants that provide inertial response and other grid services before such replacement is realized in full.

1,674,161 barrels of fossil fuel over the term of the PPA. Moreover, Hawaiian Electric believes that the operation of the Facility will contribute to the goal of reducing greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions as mandated by the State of Hawai'i. Hawaiian Electric will be submitting a GHG analysis to the Comission shortly, with the estimated GHG emissions result presented in metric tons ("MT") of carbon dioxide equivalement ("CO2e") and in kilograms COze per megawatt-
hour ("kg (02¢/MWh") for the Project lifetime.
I. REOUESTED APPROVALS Hawaiian Electric respectfully requests that the Commission issue two decisions and orders as follows:
1. First Decision and Order Request: Approval of Power Purchase Agreement (a) Approve the PPA, by and between Hawaiian Electric and Seller,8
for the Project, as further described below and attached hereto as Exhibit 1;

V. JUSTIFICATION Approval of the Project and PPA is reasonable and in the public interest for the following reasons:
(a) Consistent with the Commission's Inclinations. In the Commission's Inclinations, the Commission offered "perspectives on the vision, business strategies and regulatory policy changes required to align the Hawaiian Electric Companies' business model with customers' interests and the state's public policy goals..,16 Specifically, the Commission's 12 A redacted version of Exhibit l is attached in support ofthis Application.

8-
Inclinations urged the Hawaiian Electric Companies to seek higher penetrations of lower-cost renewables and to lower fuel costs in existing power plants.17 The PPA is consistent with these inclinations. Among other things, as noted in this Application, the PPA will increase renewable energy generation on the system and decrease the amount of fossil fuel consumption by existing power plants, thereby lowering fossil fuel purchases.
(b) Result of Competitive Procurement. The Project was selected through a competitive procurement process for defined target quantities and operation dates. This process allowed the Company to choose a portfolio of projects, including this Project, to provide the contemplated benefits the Company was seeking as part of the Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu at competitive pricing. The competitive procurement process is further described in Exhibit 2.
(c) Provides Essential Grid Services. The Project is advantageous due to the ability for the Company to dispatch the Facility's available energy in real time, allowing the Facility to potentially contribute to many ofthe grid services as proposed in the Integrated Grid Planning processls traditionally provided by conventional synchronous generation, including: Regulating Reserve, Primary Frequency Response, and Voltage Support. Hawaiian Electric will be able to dispatch energy from the Project's PV or storage system as needed to serve customer demand outside solar production hours, and to provide replacement reserves. The Facility's technical and operational capabilities will contribute to grid stabilization for faults and contingencies, subject to Facility limits and energy availability. This allows the renewable Facility to provide energy and grid services rather than relying on fossil fuel firm conventional generation units to provide 1' See Commission's Inclinations at 4.

these services. The Project has the ability to be grid-charged, allowing Hawaiian Electric greater flexibility and certainly in delivering necessary grid services. The Project can also operate in grid-forming mode, which facilitates maintaining system reliability in the future as the Company reduces or eliminates use of fossil-fueled synchronous units. Although grid-forming inverters for use in a grid of the scale of the Company's service territoly is still considered a nascent technology, these capabilities are prudent over the course of the 20-year PPA, as the Company expects increasing reliance on inverter-based resources.
(d) Renewable DiSDtchable Generation PPA. The PPA was based on the model Renewable Dispatchable Generation PPA filed with the Stage 2 RFP. Specific terms and conditions ofthe PPA were negotiated by the Company and Seller at arms-length and contain indemnification, insurance, and other provisions that will serve to protect the Company and its customers from certain risks associated with interconnecting the PV plus storage Facility.
Hawaiian Electric negotiated significant provisions to assess the Facility's availability and performance throughout the term to ensure Facility capabilities at any time it is dispatched during the Term, as further discussed in Exhibit 4.
(e) Reasonable Pricing for Customers. The Unit Price, as defined in the PPA, is advantageous in that it is fixed for the duration ofthe PPA, is not tied to the price of fossil fuels, and is anticipated to result in having only a modest impact on the effective rates for customers based on modeled assumptions. It is estimated that, as a result of the PPA, a typical residential Hawaiian Electric customer consuming 500 kWh per month will see an average bill increase of approximately $0.27 per month over the 20-year PPA term.19 However, even with such modest 19 The projected bill impact calculations are only intended to provide an illustrative example ofpotential customer bill impacts. The specific assumptions and iresults used in the bill impact calculations are provided m the evaluation 10-
price increase, the Independent Observer noted that the selection of the winning projects, including this Project, in the Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu was, on a portfolio basis, the most optimal selection from the available bids.20 Also, the Company conducted a sanity check on the entire portfolio of selected projects, including this Project, to ensure that each project would benefit the Company's customers.21 The chart below shows the Unit Prices for this Project and the other PV plus battery storage projects for the Stage 2 RFP on O'ahu that have been submitted to the Commission for approval:

BESS BCE Kupono Solar 42 MW/168 MWh $ 0.123799404
BESS attached hereto as Exhibit 3. Changes to any of these assumptions would have an impact on the results ofthe analysis. For example, an event such as the current epidemic, if such were to occur during the term of the PPA could change fuel prices, load forecasts, and other assumptions which would change the results ofthe analysis.
20 See The Independent Observer's Report Regarding Hawaiian Electric Companies' Request for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatc}table Generation and Energy Storage on (hahu in Docket No. 2017-0352 filed on October 21,2020 at page 61.
21 Itt. atpage 58.
11-
Further, this pricing is reasonable given the desirability of its site on Navy land near Pearl Harbor, as it provides increased geographic diversity relative to other sites in the final award group.
(f) Reduces Fossil Fuel Consumption. As shown in Exhibit 3, the Facility is anticipated to have a substantial positive impact by decreasing Hawaiian Electric's future dispatch of oil-fueled units.
(g) Reduces GHG Emissions. Hawaiian Electric will submit the GHG analysis to the Commission within four weeks of this submittal. The estimated GHG emissions result will be presented in MT of CO2e and in kg CO2e/MWh for the Project lifetime. Detailed calculations including assumptions and inputs will be properly documented and included with the accompanying GHG analysis report.
(h) Increase RPS. The renewable energy to be purchased from the Facility pursuant to the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the State ofHawai'i's RPS goals. As shown in Exhibit 5, Hawaiian Electric estimates that the Facility has the potential to contribute up to 1.23 percentage points of Hawaiian Electric's 2025 RPS and 0.94 percentage points towards the Hawaiian Electric Companies' consolidated 2025 RPS.
(i) Consistent with PSIP Obiectives and Decreases Reliance on Foreim Imported Oil. The Project is consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP objectives, which set forth the Companies' intention to competitively procure new grid-scale generation resources through detailed plans and actions for the years 2017 to 2021.22 The right to dispatch the Facility under the PPA will assist Hawaiian Electric in achieving the goals set forth in Hawaiian 22 See DocketNo. 2014-0183. I)&O 34696 at ES-1.
12-
Electric's PSI23 to move towards energy independence and decreased reliance on foreign imported oil while maintaining reliability ofthe Company system. The Stage 2 RFP actually sought more generation than the Companies originally planned for following their Stage 1 RFP, therefore accelerating the Company's efforts to reach RPS targets.
0) Reduced Customer Exposure to Volatilitv in Fuel Prices. The PPA reduces customer exposure to volatility in fuel prices. The PPA pricing is not linked to fossil fuel and is fixed over the term of the contract, meaning customers will not be subject to bill increases with rises in the price of fossil fuel. Further, as noted above, the PPA will result in a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New renewable energy will be generated displacing fossil fuels.
Historically, fuel prices have been volatile and willtikely continue to be unpredictable.
Reducing generation from other resources dependent on fossil fuels protects customers from the volatility of fuel prices.
VL BACKGROUND A. Procedural History As noted above, this Project is the result ofthe Company's Stage 2 RFP. The Stage 2
RFP is a continuation ofthe Hawaiian Electric Companies' efforts in their Stage 1 Requests for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation for O'ahu issued in February 2018
("Stage 1 RFPD. During the Stage 1 RFP, based on the PSIP-identified resource needs through 2022, the Companies sought up to approximately 485,000 MWh of variable renewable dispatchable generation on O'ahu. During the Stage 1 RFP, the Hawaiian Electric Companies 23 See DocketNo. 2014-0183. I)&O 34696. at ES-2.
13-
indicated that they would procure any remaining MWh of renewable generation from the Stage 1
RFPs through a Stage 2 RFP.
On February 27,2019, the Commission issued Order No. 36187, Providing Guidance in Advance of the Hawaiian Electric Companies ' Phase 2 Draft Requests for Proposals for Dispatchable andRenewable Generation C'Order 36187'3. Among other things, Order 36187
stated that the Hawaiian Electric Companies should conduct an RFP for renewable generation on the islands of O'ahu, Maui and Hawai'i to fulfill the remaining energy needs from the Stage 1
RFP as well as to meet the energy, capacity and ancillary services needs following the retirement of the AES Hawaii coal plant on O'ahu and the Kahului Power Plant on Maui. After a series of technical conferences before the Commission, advisory orders issued by the Commission, and filings by the Hawaiian Electric Companies, the Companies ultimately issued the Stage 2 RFP for O'ahu seeking up to 1,300,000 MWh ofrenewable energy, 200 MW of storage to fill the capacity need for the expiration of the AES Hawaii power purchase agreement, and 50 MW of contingency storage. Exhibit 2 provides a detailed summary ofthe RFP process.
The Stage 2 RFP required that projects have a Guaranteed Commercial Operations Date C'GCOD") no later than December 31, 2025, with the exception of projects that were intended to provide replacement capacity for AES Hawaii, such projects required a GCOD no later than May 30,2022. The intent of the short timeframe for projects to reach commercial operations was to meet the Commission's stated objectives of timely bringing on new renewable energy to displace fossil fuels. In order to meet these aggressive timelines, proposals could not require substantial infrastructure improvements in order to interconnect to the Company's system.
The Company notes that none of the Stage 2 RFP projects, including this Project, include the assumption of any Hawai'i State tax credit for renewable energy. Pursuant to Commission 14-
guidance in Order No. 36356, Providing Guidance on the Hawaiian Electric Companies ' Phase 2 Draft Requests for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation, issued on June 10, 2019, the Company removed the risk of changes in State tax policy from Seller4 and incorporated provisions in Attachment J of the PPA, which requires the developer to pass through any State tax credit received to the Company's customers. If the Project does end up being eligible for renewable energy tax credits from the State ofHawai'i, this would result in greater benefits for the Company' s customers. However, the Company notes that in 2020, the Hawai'i State Legislature passed S.B. No. 2820 S.D. 2 H.D. 225 that ends the State tax credit for utility scale solar energy projects over 5 MW that require a power purchase agreement to be approved by the Commission.
B. Project History The Kupono Solar project was first proposed by Bright Canyon Energy Corporation ("Bright Canyon Energy") in response to the Company's Stage 2 RFP. Bright Canyon Energy was selected for the Stage 2 final award group but acceptance was contingent on Bright Canyon Energy accepting potential 15 MW daytime and 30 MW nighttime output limitations, which Bright Canyon Energy agreed to in May 2020. Thereafter, the Company and Bright Canyon Energy conducted numerous negotiation sessions between May and December 2020 with a common goal of executing and filing a power purchase agreement by the original Stage 2 RFP deadline in September 2020 to the end of 2020.26 However, concurrent with its PPA negotiations with the Company, Bright Canyon Energy was participating in a request for 24 See Order No. 36356 at 24-25.
25 This bill was signed into law by the Governor on September 15, 2020 as Act 061.
26 Stage 2 REP final group awardees were required to complete negotiations and file applications far their respective PPA approvals by September 15,2020.
15-
proposals from the United States Department of the Navy (the'Navy RFP") to secure Bright Canyon Energy's land rights for its chosen site. The Navy RFP was delayed and Company agreed to extend negotiations with Bright Canyon Energy through December 2020 in order to permit Bright Canyon Energy to complete the Navy RFP process.27 However, as numerous Stage 2 RFP applications were filed on September 15,2020, to maintain the integrity of the negotiation process, no new issues could be raised for negotiation between the Parties after September 15,2020. After such date, only open items still being negotiated between Company and Bright Canyon Energy would be subject to further negotiation.
The Parties continued negotiations on the open items and were close to agreement on the PPA terms when, on December 22,2020, Bright Canyon Energy notified the Company that it was not selected as the winning bidder in the Navy RFP and would be unable to secure the required land rights for the Project. As alternatives for Bright Canyon Energy were dependent on completion of the Navy RFP process, Bright Canyon Energy ultimately withdrew its Project from the Stage 2 RFP and provided its official notice of withdrawal on January 21,2021. Bright Canyon Energy's notice, however, stated that it would continue to explore avenues to save and recommence the Project should later negotiations following completion of the Navy RFP prove fruitful.
27 Under Section 4.3 of the Stage 2 RFP, the Company recognized that obtaining site control over Government/Public Lands may not be feasible at the time ofproposal submittal. Accordingly, an accommodation was made available for sites that were planned to be situated on Government/Public Lands so long as the proposal offered a credible and viable plan to secure such land rights. Bright Canyon Energy provided such plan to the Company which, in conjunction with the IO, was deemed satisfactory. Said section, however, still required Bright Canyon Energy to provide the required site control as required under the PPA. As such, it would not be possible until after the Navy RFP process was completed, for Bright Canyon Energy to execute the PPA (which requires BCE to represent and warrant that it has allland rights necessary for the project). Accordingly, Company and Bright Canyon Energy agreed to extend the target deadline to complete negotiations on the PPA and file this application ibr approval as soon as possible following PPA execution- , 16-
Shortly thereafter, in a letter dated February 3,2021, the Commission requested that the Independent Obserber investigate the representations made in the January 21,2021 letter, and then on March 3, 2021 the Commission established a deadline of August 1, 2021 for Bright Canyon Energy to pursue pathways identified in the January 21,2021 letter and to potentially complete PPA negotiations with the Company.
In early 2021, Bright Canyon Energy was successful in obtaining authorization to enter into discussions with Ameresco, Inc. ("Ameresco"), the entity selected in the Navy RFP which had secured the land rights necessary for the Project, to explore possible options to restore the Project. In August 2021, Bright Canyon Energy notified the Company that Bright Canyon Energy and Ameresco had come to an agreement to enter into a joint venture to assume ownership ofthe Seller for the Project and expressed the desire to recommence negotiations on the PPA, and restart activities to complete the IRS and GHG analysis. Thereafter, after reviewing the proposedjoint venture structure and financial and experience information of Ameresco, the Company provided its consent to the joint venture and change of control of the Seller. On December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation with BCE Kupono Solar, LLC. Simultaneously, the Company provided its consent to the change in control of Seller and Company, and Seller executed a First Amendment to Power Purchase Agreement For Renewable Dispatchable Generation (PV + BESS) to amend certain PPA provisions to accommodate the joint venture structure of Seller between Bright Canyon Energy and Ameresco.28
28 See Exhibit 4, Key PPA Teams and Conditions for a more detailed description ofthe amendments made to the PPA to accommodate the joint venture of the Seller.

C. Policy Objeclives As noted above, this Project is consistent with the Hawaiian Electric Companies' PSIP objectives. Further, the Project is consistent with many tenets ofthe State ofHawai'i's energy policy, which encourages the use and development of renewable energy.29 The Project will help Hawaiian Electdc meet the State's energy policy goals by reducing Hawaiian Electric's reliance on fossil fuels and implementing additional renewable energy resources, with the operational flexibility and technical characteristics to support 100% renewable goals. The State's overall energy objectives are set forth in HRS § 226-18(a), which states, in relevant part:
(a) Planning for the State's facility systems with regard to energy shall be directed toward the achievement of the following objectives, giving due consideration to all:
(1) Dependable, efficient, and economical statewide energy systems capable of supporting the needs of the people;
(2) Increased energy self-sufficiency where the ratio of indigenous to imported energy use is increased;
(3) Greater energy security and diversification in the face of threats to Hawaii's energy supplies and systems; [and] (4) Reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply and use....
The objectives in the area ofrenewable energy are to promote commercialization of Hawai'i's sustainable energy resources and technologies to reduce the State's high dependence on imported oil, increase local economic development, and reduce the potential negative economic impacts of oil price fluctuations. In support of these renewable energy objectives, Hawai'i's RPS law was establishedby the State Legislature in 2001, and amended in 2006,2009, 29 See Title 15, Chapter 269, Part V, HRS.
18-
and 2015. Pursuant to HRS § 269-92(a), each electric utility company3o that sells electricity for consumption in Hawai'i is required by law to establish a RPS of: (a) 30% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2020; (b) 40% of its net electricity sales by December 31,2030; (c) 70% of its net electricity sales by December 31,2040; and (d) 100% of its net electricity sales by December 31,2045. In addition, HRS § 269-92(b)(1) requires that after December 31,2014, the entire RPS be met by electrical energy generated using renewable energy sources, and HRS § 269-92(b)(2) requires that beginning January 1,2015, electrical energy savings shall not count toward the RPS. The Project will assist Hawaiian Electric in satisfying these RPS goals, and will give Hawaiian Electric the opportunity to increase its annual RPS contribution on average 1.11
percentage points over the 20-year term of the PPA and increase the Hawaiian Electric Companies' annual consolidated RPS on average 0.85 percentage points,31 as further shown in Exhibit 5.
D. Greenhouse Gas Emissions The renewable energy objectives also encompass HRS § 269-6(b) which requires that the Commission:
[C]onsider the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels through energy efficiency and increased renewable energy generation in exercising its authority and duties under this chapter.
In making determinations of the reasonableness ofthe costs ofutility system capital improvements and operations, the [C]ommission shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or qualitatively, the effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions. The [C]omission may determine that short-term costs or direct costs that are higher than alternatives relying more heavily on fossil fuels are reasonable, considering the impacts resulting from the use of fossil fuels.
30 Pursuant to HRS § 269-93, "[aln electric utility company and its electric utility affiliales may aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve the [RPS]." 31 See Exhibit 5.

The methodology described below will be utilized to estimate the GHG emissions associated with the proposed Project. Hawaiian Electric will submit the GHG analysis as described below, to the Commission within four weeks of this Application.
This approach addresses the Upstream, Construction, Operations, and Downstream Stages, as shown in Figure 1, below.
Figure 1. Stages for Consideration in GHG Emissions Calculation Upstream Stages  Operations , .
Downstream Stages Raw Materia Is Extraction & -* Transportation  -+ Construction -+ USE Decommissioning -A Transportation -6 Displ Manufacturing i Potentially significant and reasonably foreseeable equipment, materials and activities are accounted for throughout the Project lifecycle. The following sections provide an overview of the methodology for the Upstream, Operations and Downstream Stages.
1. Upstream Stages Upstream Stages include the raw materials extraction, manufacturing, transportation and construction stages of the Project, including GHG emissions that occur off-
island. GHG emissions associated with raw material extraction and manufacturing are for equipment and materials installed or used during the Project. The GHG emissions for upstream stages also consider total number of pieces of equipment within the project lifetime.
The Transportation and Construction Stages' GHG emissions are calculated using an "inventory approach" where estimated direct GHG emissions from transportation and construction are calculated based on Project- and location-specific data. This includes Upstream and Downstream transportation for material and equipment from manufacturer locations which J 20-
are mostly off-island to the Project Site and from the Project Site to disposal locations. The Construction Stage includes GHG emissions produced during construction ofthe Project, including on-road and off-road construction GHG emissions associated with site development foundation or civil work and installation ofnew equipment.
2. Operations Stage Operations Emissions include direct GHG emissions associated with the operation and maintenance ofthe Project (e.g., the "Operations Stage" shown in Figure 1). The Operations Stage includes GHG emissions generated from operation and maintenance activities of the equipment and materials in scope for the Project, including onsite energy; material and water use; mobile trips required for worker commute, and maintenance or other operational mobile trips.
3. Downstream Stages The Downstream Stages include GHG emissions from transportation, distribution, decommissioning and disposal ofthe proposed equipment at such time the Project is decommissioned after the projected Project lifetime.
4. Avoided Emissions Avoided emissions will be analyzed using the projected amount of fossil fuel that will be avoided as a result of the Project for the duration of the PPA and as further discussed in Exhibit 3 of this Application. The analysis will focus solely on direct emissions since those emissions alone are expected to be significantly higher than those of the Project, and represent the majority ofprojected GHG emissions from avoided fuel consumption ifthe Project were not built.
21-
5. Net GHG Emissions Net GHG Emissions will demonstrate the benefits of the Project over the Avoided scenario in terms of GHG emissions. Estimated Net GHG Emissions are defined as the estimated Avoided GHG Emissions from Fossil-Fueled Plants minus estimated GHG emissions from the Project. The lower the Project's GHG Emissions relative to the Avoided GHG Emissions, the higher the Net Emissions reduction.
6. Report As previously stated, Hawaiian Electric will submit the GHG analysis as described above to the Commission within four weeks ofthis Application. The estimated GHG emissions result using the methodology described above will be presented in MTof C(he and in kg COWMWh for the Project lifetime. Detailed calculations including assumptions and inputs will be properly documented and included with the accompanying GHG analysis report.
Accordingly, Commission approval ofthe PPA for the Project: (1) will give Hawaiian Electric the opportunily to increase its annual RPS contribution,32 (2) is consistent with the State's energy policy encouraging the use and development of renewable energy resources; (3) advances the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels and the reduction of GHG emissions as articulated in HRS § 269-6(b); (4) promotes the State's overall energy objectives set forth in HRS § 226-18(a); and (5) supports the goals of HRS § 225P by reducing the atmospheric carbon and GHG emissions produced by the State.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Description ofDeveloper Seller is a Delaware limited liability company in good standing and is a wholly-owned subsidiary ofKupono Solar Development Company, LLC, which is a Delaware limited liability company jointly-owned by subsidiaries ofBright Canyon Energy Corporation and Ameresco, Inc. The ownership structure of Seller is attached as Exhibit A-2 to the PPA. Seller is in good standing with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawai'i. A copy of Seller's Certificate of Good Standing is attached as Exhibit A-1 to Attachment A ofthe PPA.

B. Site and Facilitv The proposed Facility will be located on land particularly identified by Tax Map Key Nos.1-9-1-001:011,1-9-1-010: 122 and 1-9-1-001:031. The land secured by Seller is approximately 128 acres of federal land under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Navy at the West Loch Annex of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. State, city and county zoning and land use classifications are not applicable to these lands. A map showing the general location ofthe Project site is attached as Exhibit 6.
Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller is responsible to coastruct,33 own and operate the proposed 42 MW Facility, including all Seller-owned interconnection facilities and all other equipment, devices, associated appurtenances owned, controlled, operated, and managed by Seller in connection with, or to facilitate, the production, generation, transmission, delivery, or furnishing of electric energy by Seller to Hawaiian Electric, in parallel with Hawaiian Electric's 33 Seller, as a developer ofrenewable energy systems, intends to hire a properly licensed contractor to build the proposed renewable energy facility that is classified as an eligible resource under Hawai'i's Renewable Portfolio Slandards Statute, HRS §§ 269-91 - 269-95. See PPA at 1.
24-
system. Electric energy produced by the Facility will be provided by Seller to Hawaiian Electric and delivered to the Point of Interconnection in response to Company Dispatch of the Facility.
The Seller anticipates that this Project, if approved, would support up to 100 construction jobs within the State of Hawai'i. This would be in addition to the employees supporting the Project and located in Seller's Honolulu office.
Seller represents and warrants that, as of the Commercial Operations Date of the Facility ("COD"), the Facility will be a qualified renewable resource under the RPS in effect as of the effective date of the PPA ("Effective Date") and that, absent a change in RPS law, any and all energy produced by the Facility during the term of the PPA will meet the definition of "renewable electrical energy" or "renewable energy" as defined under HRS § 269-91.34
The Facility is capable of generating up to 42 MW and will consist of over 100,000 solar photovoltaic modules mounted on fixed-tilt racking and twelve (12) 4.2 MW inverters. Powered by solar energy with additional on-site battery energy storage, the Facility is capable of generating power used by an estimated 10,000 homes. Preliminary screening identified that an operational constraint may need to be imposed during operation due to existing terminal or reliability constraints on the Company's system. The Project was evaluated based on these preliminary limits, assuming no additional infrastructure or system improvements would be put in place and such evaluation was taken into account during final selection. The IRS will determine the final operational constraint to be imposed. Seller has agreed to this potential operational constraint as a condition to accepting its place in the final award group for the Stage 2 RFP.
34 See PPA at § 22.2(e) and preamble.
25-
The storage component of the Facility will comprise of a 42 MW / 168 MWh lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage System (MBESS"). The BESS will consist of battery modules, inverter systems, and control equipment. The BESS will charge from energy collected by the PV component of the Facility. The BESS will also have the ability to charge from energy provided by the Hawaiian Electric grid upon the expiration of the federal investment tax credit recapture period.
The key benefit of the PV plus storage Facility, contracted through the RDG PPA, is that the Company will be able to utilize renewable energy produced by the Facility during periods of system demand, outside of PV production hours. Having the PV system paired with the BESS adds significant value to the Facility by allowing the energy produced duing the day that cannot be readily accepted by the Company to be stored and dispatched to the Company's system at future times of higher customer demand, which is more beneficial to the Company's system than past projects that required instantaneous use of energy produced. The BESS energy supplements the PV energy in meeting the Company's dispatch and thereby reduces volatility and variabilily of the PV energy resource, allowing the Facility to be semi-dispatchable and able to contribute to reserves. The storage allows the PV energy to be shifted to periods of peak energy demand, and other non-solar periods, that could otherwise require fossil generation to meet. The charged storage contributes to the primary frequency response of the Facility, and can assist in grid stabilization subject to discharge limits. See Exhibit 3, Attachment 7 for the representative dispatch ofthe Project.
The Seller's receipt of the full Lump Sum Payment per payment period is contingent on the Facility meeting the Performance Metrics specified in the PPA. If the Facility fails to satisfy one or more of the Performance Metrics, liquidated damages will be assessed against the full 26-
Lump Sum Payment amount. Liquidated damages tied directly to the capacity of the BESS will be assessed based on the BESS Allocated Portion of the Lump Sum Payment, which is 50% of the full Lump Sum Payment. The Lump Sum Payment, as affected by liquidated damages for the availability ofthe Facility and other Performance Metrics, has the potential to reduce down to zero if the Facility is completely unavailable or if the Facility is available but underperforming in other aspects as measured by the Performance Metrics. See Exhibit 4 for further information regarding the PPA Performance Metrics and Liquidated Damages Assessment.
VII[. INTERCONNECTION The Facility will interconnect to the Company's existing 46 kV transmission line. To ensure the Project is completed in a timely manner and to preserve the Seller's ability to seek the federal investment tax credits that began to phase out in 2019, and are scheduled to expire in 2022, but which can be safe harbored and claimed after 2022, the Parties agreed to execute the PPA prior to the completion of the IRS for the Project.35 Following completion ofthe IRS, the Parties will execute an Interconnection Requirements Amendment, substituting new versions of attachments to the PPA, including, but not limited to, Attachment A (Description of Generation, Conversion and Storage Facilily), Attachment B (Facility Owned by Seller), Attachment E (Single-Line Drawing and Interface Block Diagram), Attachment F (Relay List and Trip Scheme), Attachment G (Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities), Attachment K (Guaranteed Project Milestones), Attachment K-1 (Seller's Conditions Precedent and Company Milestones), and Attachment L (Reporting Milestones) to reflect the results of the IRS.36
Daytime and nighttime output limitations for the Project will be identified and confirmed in the 35 See PPA § 12.4.
36 See PPA § 12.*a).
27-
IRS. The Interconnection Requirements Amendment will also reflect the Company's estimate of total interconnection Costs based on the results of the IRS, as well as the project development schedule agreed to by the Company and Seller. The Company will submit the Interconnection Requirements Amendment to the Commission in a subsequent informational filing.
Pursuant to Section 12.4(b) of the PPA, if Seller is dissatisfied with the results of the IRS (because, for example, of the technical requirements imposed or the cost of the interconnection work), Seller has the option, by written notice delivered to the Company no later than the Termination Deadline,37 to declare the PPA null and void. Notably, the PPA does not allow for any adjustment to pricing upon completion ofthe IRS and interconnection cost estimates.
The Parties entered into the Recommencing Interconnection Requirements Study (System Impact Study and Facility Study) Letter Agreement on September 23, 2021, and the IRS is progressing as the Company is in the process of completing the analyses for the system impact study and preparing to begin the facility study.
IX. PPA TERMS AND CONDITIONS The terms and conditions of the PPA were negotiated by the Parties at arms-length. Due to Bright Canyon Energy's initial failure to obtain land rights for the Project and the subsequent change in control of the Seller, active negotiations were commenced in May 2020, halted in December 2020, recommenced in October 2021, and completed in December 2021.
Because of the extended nature of negotiations for this PPA, the most important consequence of such extended time is the Parties' agreement to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operations Date, from the original June 1,2022 date proposed by Seller in its 37 As defined in the PPA, "Tennination Deadline" means the 30th day following the date the completed IRS (including the Total Estimated Interconnection Costs and project schedule completed by Company) is provided to Seller. or such later date as Company and Seller may agree to by a written agreement.
28-
original proposal, to April 9,2024. This extension was necessary given the extended negotiations required to permit Seller to negotiate a satisfactory agreement to secure the land rights necessary for the Project. Company and Seller believe the current GCOD is reasonable and attainable given the past, current and anticipated future circumstances surrounding the Project and issues experienced over the past two years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The PPA contains indemnification, insurance, pricing, and other provisions, including those pertaining to the Term, Seller's delivery of dispatchable energy from the Facility, and Seller's compliance with laws, which will serve to protect the Company and its customers from certain risks associated with interconnecting with the Facility. Moreover, the terms and conditions ofthe PPA will not affect the Company's ability to provide electric service to its customers and are not discriminatory to other small power producers. Hawaiian Electric maintains that, for these reasons, the purchased power arrangements (i.e., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric purchases rights to dispatch energy from Seller's Facility, are prudent and in the public interest.
Pursuant to Section 12.3(b) of the PPA, Seller shall seek participation without intervention in the Commission Docket for the approval of this Application for the limited purpose and only to the extent necessary to assist the Commission in making an informed decision regarding the approval of the PPA. The scope of Seller's participation shall be determined by the Commission.
A detailed summary and discussion ofthe key terms and conditions ofthe RDG PPA are set forth in the document entitled "Key PPA Terms and Conditions," attached hereto as Exhibit 29-
X. COMMUNITY OUTREACH Pursuant to the community outreach requirements set forth in the RFP, Seller was required to develop a comprehensive communily outreach and communications plan to work with and inform neighboring communities and stakeholders about the Project and to gain support for the Project. Seller agreed to provide information to the neighboring communities and stakeholders on a timely basis during all phases of the Project. Seller's community engagement document is a public document and Seller was required to create a Project website that contained meaningful information about the proposed Project as well as their community outreach plan.38
The Company's Renewable Project Status Board was updated to identify all projects selected into the final award group of the Stage 2 RFP and provided links to those individual project websites in a consolidated location for interested community members and stakeholders.39 Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Seller was required to conduct a virtual public meeting either televised or online, and incorporate technology that allowed for live engagement and interaction between the Seller and community participants. The intent of the meeting was to gather stakeholders and other interested parties in the area to apprise the community about the Project, and to allow an opportunity for community concerns and questions to be raised. In addition, Seller was required to perform media outreach and advertising to raise community awareness of any public meeting. Seller was also required to account for the Project's potential impacts on historical and cultural resources and to share such information with the neighboring community.
Further, Seller was required to designate an individual as the Seller's Community Representative.

Article 29.21 ofthe PPA details the Seller's community outreach obligations during the entire development period, which include soliciting written community comments, and submitting all written community comments received by December 31, 2021 as part ofthis Application.40 Seller's virtual community meeting was held on July 9,2020 and the thirty day public comment period closed on August 8, 2020.41 However, Seller has confirmed that it has not received any additional comments between August 8,2020 and December 31,2021. Seller's current Community Representative is listed in Article 29.21(e) ofthe PPA. Attached as Exhibit 7 are copies ofpublic comments from Seller's community outreach efforts, as well as a summary of Seller's community outreach efforts made to date. Additional written comments received after the compilation of this Application will be filed in this docket no later than with the filing of the Company's Reply Statement of Position.
X1. ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB') Accounting Standards Codification C'ASC'7 810, Consolidation, addresses variable interest entities C'VIE") and primary beneficiaries (entities that consolidate VIEs). FASB ASC 810 could potentially require that the purchaser under a PPA, such as Hawaiian Electric, consolidate the Seller, such as BCE Kupono Solar, LLC. If the PPA is determined to constitute a variable interest in Seller and that Hawaiian Electric is the primary beneficiary, then Hawaiian Electric will be required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements. Consolidating Seller onto Hawaiian Electric's financial statements will have uncertain impacts on the assessments of investors and/or credit rating agencies on the risks associated with this PPA and Hawaiian Electric's creditworthiness. In addition, if 40 See PPA at § 29.21.
41 See Exhibit 7.
31-
Hawaiian Electric is required to consolidate Seller onto its financial statements, then Hawaiian Electric's management will be required to assess the adequacy ofits internal controls over financial reporting, in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Hawaiian Electric is unwilling to be subject to accounting treatment that results from Variable Interest Entity treatment as set forth in FASB ASC 810.42
A preliminary consolidation evaluation of the PPA and Seller was performed under FASB ASC 810, and it appears consolidation is not required. An evaluation will be performed when Commission approval is received. Thereafter, FASB ASC 810 requires Hawaiian Electric to continuously reassess its evaluation on an on-going basis.
A. Lease Accounting FASB ASC 842, Leases, effective January 1, 2019, specifies tests to be applied to an arrangement, in this case, the PPA, to determine: (1) whether or notthe arrangement contains a lease and specifies the circumstances under which an arrangement should be evaluated to determine whether or not it contains a lease; and (2) if it is deemed a lease, whether it is an operating or finance lease.
If the PPA is deemed a lease, it would be classified as either an operating or a finance lease. If it is deemed an operating lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset lease obligation, and lease expense. If the PPA is deemed a finance lease, Hawaiian Electric will report the right-of-use asset, lease obligation and related interest and amortization expense.
A preliminary evaluation of the PPA was performed under FASB ASC 842, which resulted in the identification of the PV system and the BESS as separate units of account for lease consideration. Based on the preliminary evaluation, the PV system was concluded to not 42 See PPA at § 24.5.
32-
contain a lease, while the BESS was concluded to contain a lease. As such, a right-of-use asset and lease liability will be recorded on Hawaiian Electric's financial statements for the present value of the fixed payments attributable to the BESS over the term of the PPA. A final evaluation will be performed upon Commission approval of the PPA.
For U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") purposes, if the PPA or a portion thereof is an operating lease, the lease expense would be straight-lined throughout the term of the lease, and ifthe PPA or portion thereof is a finance lease, the lease will have a front-loaded expense recognition. However, Hawaiian Electric requests that for rate-making purposes, the actual payments under the PPA be recorded as a purchase power expense and the difference between the actual payments and the lease expense be reflected as a regulatory asset/liability for the entire term ofthe PPA.
B. Imnact of Iminuted Debt on Credit Oualitv The payments Hawaiian Electric is required to make under this PPA are for availability and performance of renewable dispatchable generation, as well as the energy dispatched by the Company, as set forth in the PPA. A preliminary evaluation ofthe PPA was performed and it appears that the PV system does not contain a lease while the BESS appears to contain a lease.
Since the PV system appears to not contain a lease, there is no recorded liability for the long-
term lease expense payment attributable to the PV system. However, credit rating agencies would reflect these obligations as imputed debt in the ratios used to evaluate Hawaiian Electric's risk profile, which drive the resulting credit rating. Since the BESS unit appears to contain a lease, a right-of-use asset and lease liability will be recorded. The Company's understanding is that Standard & Poor's ("S&P") will continue to use this information in its analysis and will use the lease liability in calculating the debt to be imputed for PPA-related fixed obligations. On 33-
May 7,2007, S&P published an article titled "Standard & Poor's Methodology For Imputing Debt For U.S. Utilities' Power Purchase Agreements" CS&P's 5-7-07 Article"). In this article, S&P imputes debt for fixed PPA obligations and includes this imputed debt in its analysis ofa company's financial metrics.
New lease accounting rules effective January 1,2019 will require all leases with terms greater than twelve months to be included on the balance sheet. On April 16, 2018, S&P published a Credit FAQ titled"What Do New Lease Accounting Changes Mean For Corporate Credit Ratings?" ("S&P's 4-16-18 Article"). In this article, S&P states:
