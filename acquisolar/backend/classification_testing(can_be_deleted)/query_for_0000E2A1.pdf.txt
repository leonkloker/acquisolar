C. PROJECT BACKGROUND.
On October 6, 2017, the Commission opened Docket No. 2017-0352 To Institute a Proceeding Relating to a Competitive Bidding Process To Acquire Dispatchable and Renewable Generation.9 The purpose of the docket was to ...receive filings, review approval requests, and resolve disputes, if necessary, related to the Hawaiian Electric Companies' requests to proceed with competitive procurement of dispatchable firm generation and new renewable energy generation on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, and Lanal.10
The Commission provided various requirements for the competitive procurement process through this docketll and appointed Navigant Consulting, Inc. ("Navigant") as the Independent Observer flo") for the Maui Variable Request for Proposals CRFP") and Maui Firm RFP, and Bates White, LLC ("Bates White") as the IO for the Oahu and Hawaii Island Variable RFPs.

worked with the respective IOs to draft proposed Final Variable RFPs. The Commission declined to pre-approve any form or version of the draft PPAs but directed the Hawaiian Electric Companies to allow bidders to propose modifications to either the Draft Model Renewable Dispatchable Generation ("RDG") PPA or the previously utilized Risk Adjusted Pricing ("RAP") PPA when submitting their bids.12 The Commission approved the Hawaiian Electric Companies' Proposed Final Variable Requests for Proposals, with modification, on February 20, 2018.13
On February 27,2018, the Hawaiian Electric Companies issued their Phase 1 Final Variable requests for Proposals, in which they indicated their intention to select a total of five projects: two projects on Oahu, one project on Hawaii island, and two projects on Maui island.14 On June 15, 2018, the Commission issued Order No. 35529 Authorizing The Hawaiian Electric Companies To Expand The Number Of Projects Selected For Their Respective Final Award Groups Pursuant To The Final Variable Requests For Proposals Submissions ("Order No. 35529"), authorizing the Hawaiian Electric Companies to expand the number of projects selected for the Final Award Group of each Company based on the results of the evaluation process and a review of results with the respective IOs, and to prioritize projects paired with energy storage.15 The Hawaiian Electric 12 Order No. 35224, at 36.

2018-0431 6
Companies state that they ultimately selected eight projects: four projects on Oahu, two projects on Hawaii island, and two projects on Maui island.16
On December 31, 2018, the Hawaiian Electric Companies submitted for Commission approval applications for seven Power Purchase Agreements: Docket Nos. 2018-0430 (Hawaii Electric Light - AES Waikoloa), 2018-0431 (Hawaiian Electric - Hoohana), 2018-0432 (Hawaii Electric Light - Hale Kuawehi), 2018-0433 (Maui Electric - Paeahu), 2018-0434 (Hawaiian Electric - Mililani), 2018-0435 (Hawaiian Electric - Waiawa), and 2018-0436 (Maui Electric - AES Kuihelani).17
On January 14, 2019, the Commission filed Order No. 36068 in this proceeding, which identified the following issues to be considered in the evaluation of the proposed PPA:
1. Whether HECO has met its burden of proof in support of its request for approval of the PPA between HECO and Ho'ohana, dated December 27, 2018, for a 52-MW photovoltaic project, coupled with a 218 MWh BESS, proposed to be located in Kunia, on the island of Oahu.
a. Whether HECO's purchased power arrangements under the PPA, pursuant to which HECO will dispatch energy on an availability basis from Ho'ohana, including the Lump Sum Payments to be paid to Ho'ohana, are prudent and in the public interest with explicit consideration, if required by law under HRS § 269-6, of the effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.
b. Whether the purchased energy charges based on the Energy Price to be paid by HECO pursuant to the PPA are just and reasonable.
16 Application, Exhibit 2, at 3 and 6.
17 Based on The Independent Observer's report Regarding Hawaiian Electric Companies' Request for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation on Oahu by Bates White CIO Report"), it appears that the Oahu RFP Final Award Group included an AES Distributed Energy project at Barbers Point. See 10 Report, at 23.
2018-0431 7
2. Whether HECO has met its burden of proof in support of its request to include payments for energy on a per kWh basis under the PPA, and related revenue taxes, through the ECRC and to include all non-energy payments under the PPA, including the Lump Sum Payment (as defined in the PPA) , and related revenue taxes, through the PPAC, to the extent such costs are not included in base rates.
3. Whether it is in the public interest for the 138 kV line extension, required to interconnect the Project to HECO's system, to be constructed above the surface of the ground pursuant to HRS § 269-27.6 (a) & (b). (footnote omitted)18
As discussed earlier, the Commission stated that it would issue a separate procedural order to govern Hawaiian Electric's above-ground 138 kV line extension-related requests.
D. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PPA.
Some of the salient terms and conditions of the Proposed PPA are as follows:
• The initial term of the proposed PPA is 20 years ('Initial Term") following the Commercial Operations date.19
• The Seller is paid a monthly Lump Sum Payment in return for making available for dispatch the Net Energy Potential ("NEP") of facility.20 The Lump Sum Payment is adjusted periodically as the NEP is reassessed, 18 Order No. 36072 at 7-8.
19 PPA, Section 12.1.
20 The NEP reflects the "theoretical annual energy delivery of the Facility's photovoltaic system to the Point of Interconnection assuming "typical" availability and "representative" meteorological conditions at the site, with a probability exceedance of 95%." Application, Exhibit 4, at 6, and also PPA, Attachment U.
2018-0431 8
based on the independent engineer CIE") Energy Assessment Report and on Operational Energy Production Reports COEPR").21
• The monthly Lump Sum Payment is equal to one-twelfth of the Unit Price multiplied by the NEP.22 The Unit Price is $0.09885800264 per kWh of NEP annually.23
• There is an energy payment of $0.00092/kWh24 and payment fortest energy at a rate of $0.045/kWh.25
• If the facility does not meet certain performance metrics related to its PV System Equivalent Availability Factor ("EAF"), Guaranteed Performance Ratio ("GPR"), BESS Capacity Test, BESS EAF, and BESS Equivalent Forced Outage Factor ("EFOF"), Seller is obligated to pay liquidated damages, as described in Sections 2.5 through 2.10 of the PPA.
• Seller must meet certain reporting and project milestone dates, as described in Section 13 and Attachment K-1 of the PPA.
• Seeker must obtain at its expense any and all Land Rights required for the construction, ownership, operation, and maintenance of the Facility and 21 pPA, Attachment U.
22 As indicated previously, the NEP may be adjusted as described in Attachments J and U of the PPA.
23 Application, Exhibit 1, at 177.
24 As originally set forth in Exhibit 4, page 7, the energy rate was $0.095 per kWh. However, on February 5, 2019, Hawaiian Electric filed copies of the First Amendment to the Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation, dated February 1, 2019 between Seller and Hawaiian Electric, which corrected a typographical error and stated that the energy rate would be $0.00092/kWh. The Consumer Advocate assumes that Hawaiian Electric is implicitly seeking approval of the First Amendment as well as the RDG PPA with Seller.
25 See PPA, Exhibit 4 at 7.

interconnection of the Facility to the grid, as described in Section 11 of the PPA.
11. DISCUSSION.
A. WHETHER THE COMMISSION SHOULD APPROVE THE PROPOSED PPA.
In its review, the Consumer Advocate considered the following factors:
• The procurement process.
• The pricing associated with the proposed PPA.
• The terms and conditions of the proposed PPA.
• Community Outreach • Other factors.
1. The Procurement Process.
As discussed above, the proposed PPA is a direct result of the RFP process conducted in Docket No. 2017-0352. As part of that process, pursuant to the Framework for Competitive Bidding, dated December 8,2006 ("Competitive Bidding Framework" or the "Framework"),26 the IOs (i.e., Navigant and Bates White) monitored the procurement 26 The Competitive Bidding Framework was approved by the Commission in Decision and Order No. 23121, filed on December 8,2006, in Docket No. 03-0372.
2018-0431 10
process and their final redacted version of the reports were filed on February 7, 2019.27
Based on its review, the Consumer Advocate summarizes several of the factors and analyses considered by the IO in supporting the selection of the final award group for the islands of Maui, Hawaii, and Oahu, which the proposed PPA is included, in Attachment 1
of this statement of position.
That being said, although not discussed in the Final 10 Report, the Consumer Advocate notes that all four developers associated with the seven projects with PPAs currently before the Commission are represented by the same counsel:
Yamamoto Caliboso, a Limited Liability Law Company ("Yamamoto Caliboso").28 In an effort to further understand the role of counsel in the bid process, submission of BAFOs, and PPA negotiations, the Consumer Advocate submitted IRs to the Hawaiian Electric Companies.
The Hawaiian Electric Companies stated that they did not know whether and to what extent Sellers' counsel was involved in responding or otherwise advising Sellers 27 The Commission filed the redacted final reports of the IOs for phase 1 of the RFP process (collectively refers to the "10 Final Reports"), which includes the: (1) Maui Electric Company Request for Proposals for Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation Closing Report of Navigant Consulting, Inc. as Independent Observer, dated February 6, 2019 ("Maui Variable IO Report"); (2) Bates White's Independent Observer's Report Regarding Hawaiian Electric Companies' Request for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation on Hawaii Island," dated January 24, 2019 ("Hawaii Variable IO Report"); and (3) Bates White's Independent Observer's Report Regarding Hawaiian Electric Companies' Request for Proposals for Dispatchable and Renewable Generation on Oahu, dated January 24, 2019 ("Oahu Variable IO Report"). Subsequently on March 1, 2019, the Hawaiian Electric Companies filed the unredacted information associated with the 10 Final Reports.

Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Maui Electric each indicated that they had "several concerns when the Company became aware that the same attorney(s) were representing all of the developers named to the Final Award Group."30 Each company states:
While the Company assumes and has no indication to suggest otherwise that each bid was submitted without collusion, the fact that multiple bidders possibly utilized the same legal counsel during their bid preparation did raise concerns as to whether bids were, in fact, submitted independently and without the sharing of information or guidance from their shared legal counsel... [H]aving a shared attorney between developers does raise a potential issue that the Company intends to specifically address in Phase 2 of this proceeding.
...The Company had concerns that during PPA negotiations, the shared attorney(s) representing the developers could in theory use information and, in particular, concessions gained in one negotiation to obtain the same or substantially similar concessions to benefit other developers in other negotiation sessions. In fact, in several circumstances, counsel for the developers requested that the Company give one developer the same concession the shared attorney's other client(s) had attained the Company's agreement to give on another project.31
Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Maui Electric each state:
The Company and Independent Observer did not discuss concerns during the evaluation and selection process that multiple projects were represented by the same legal counsel.32
30 See for example Hawaiian Electric's response to CA/HECO-IR-25.b in Docket No. 2018-0435.
Similar responses were provided in Docket Nos. 2018-0430, 2018-0431, 2018-0432, 2018-0434, and 2018-0436.

2018-0431 13
Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light note, however, that "the issue was considered and discussed by the Company and the Independent Observer during contract negotiations."33
Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light did not provide further detail regarding what was discussed with the IO with respect to all four developers (seven projects) being represented by the same attorneys and that the same attorney appears to have served as lead attorney on for all seven PPAs. The Consumer Advocate observes that most of the comments made by the IOs with respect to the competitive bidding process appear to focus on whether the Hawaiian Electric Companies' evaluations were transparent and reasonable and done "on a fair and consistent basis. "34
To the extent that the IOs provided comments regarding PPA negotiations, they do not appear to have raised any issues regarding the process or with the terms that were ultimately negotiated.
With respect to bidding stage of the Maui RFP, Navigant stated:
We believe that [the] number of Respondents provided a sufficient range of choices and competition to the Company considering the relatively small size and remote location of the Company system compared to other solicitations we have observed or performed.35
Regarding the negotiation stage, Navigant stated:
Each finalist requested changes to the PPA beyond the markup they had originally submitted. The Company resisted these changes, but did consider and compromise on some key changes requested by the Finalists in the areas of BESS performance, payment of [liquidated damages], time period for [Commission] approval, guaranteed Project and reporting milestone dates and delay damages. The changes are not unfair to the other Proposers not 33 See Hawaiian Electric's response to CA/HECO-IR-25.a in Docket No. 2018-0435. Similar responses were provided in Docket Nos. 2018-0430, 2018-0431, 2018-0432, and 2018-0434.

selected as Finalists and do not materially alter the risk balance between the Company and the seller as contemplated in the original model RDG PPA.36
In discussing the PPA negotiations forthe Hawaii island PPAs, Bates White stated:
Importantly, we observed that HELCO retained key provisions of the PPA that protect ratepayers and require the winning bidder to perform as promised. For example, both bidders sought latitude on their guaranteed commercial operations date; HELCO resisted, insisting that the bidders meet the commercial operations date specified in their bids. In other cases, HELCO pushed back against the bidders when those bidders suggested changes to the PPA during negotiations that were not included as redlines to the draft PPA as part of their bids.
One noteworthy change to the draft PPA included in the RFP documents that occurred during negotiations was the separation of the performance metrics and liquidated damages provisions for the PV systems and the battery storage systems. This structural change in the PPAs was made by HELCO in response to requests by bidders (in this RFP and the others) for greater clarity around the performance requirements of the PPA. This approach, which was agreed to by all winning bidders, had the benefit of clarifying what was expected of both the PV and battery storage systems under the PPA and removing ambiguity.
37
Bates White made similar observations regarding the Oahu PPA negotiations.38
As such, the Consumer Advocate notes that there is no evidence of collusion thus far between developers, that developers were required to agree to a "Certificate of Non-Collusion acknowledgement,"39 and that the IOs did not identify terms that appeared 36 Maui Variable IO Report, at 20.
37 Hawaii Variable 10 Report, at 25.

39 See, for example, Response to CA/HECO-IR-27.b.

unreasonable resulting from the PPA negotiations.40 At the same time, the Consumer Advocate is concerned that having one attorney lead negotiations for all four developers' PPAs gives rise to, at a minimum, the appearance of impropriety. Even if such an arrangement does not raise confidentiality issues or conflicts of interest between the developers, it is unclearthat having one attorney negotiate on behalf of all developers is in the best interest of consumers. While the IOs did not identify any terms or conditions that were "unfair," the Consumer Advocate believes having one attorney or set of attorneys handling all developers' negotiations raises the question, "Would the terms have been more favorable to consumers (rather than developers) if information regarding utility concessions had not been shared?"41
The Consumer Advocate believes that, if more time were available to examine this issue, additional information would be useful to address the possible appearance of impropriety. However, as will be discussed below, the Consumer Advocate notes that the potential savings from the proposed PPA could yield benefits to consumers and further certain State goals and will not object to the proposed PPA on the basis of the possible appearance of impropriety. The Consumer Advocate contends, however, that this issue should be addressed in future competitive procurements to mitigate the possibility of similar circumstances.
40 Bates White noted, for example, that Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light "retained key provisions of the PPA that protect ratepayers and require the winning bidder to perform as promised." See Oahu Variable IO Report, at 27, and Hawaii Variable 10 Report, at 25.
41 Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light, and Mauj Electric state that "in several circumstances, counsel for the developers requested that the Company give one developer the same concessions the shared attorney's other client(s) had attained the Company's agreement to give on another project." See, for example, response to CA/HECO-IR-27.b.

2. Price Associated With the Proposed PPA.
As discussed in Attachment 2 of the statement of position, the Consumer Advocate generally describes the review that it conducted based on the expedited timeframe. The Consumer Advocate considered several of the same factors considered in by the IOs.
One such factor was the levelized price associated with the proposed PPA. As noted in Attachment 2, while the levelized price of the proposed PPA is higherthan the Unit Price, the Consumer Advocate believes that although levelized pricing is informative, especially when comparing projects that utilize the same type(s) of technologies and have similar characteristics, the Consumer Advocate recognizes that other factors, such as when and how the energy will be used must be considered in determining the value of the project to the grid. That said, the Consumer Advocate also reviewed the estimated bill impact associated with the proposed PPA, which as shown on Attachment 2, will result in an estimated bill savings to customers. The Consumer Advocate notes that the estimated bill impacts discussed in Attachment 2 are consistent with the 10's analyses noted in Tablesl.11 andl.12.
Notwithstanding the observations discussed in Attachment 2, the Consumer Advocate contends that it is still incumbent upon the Commission and Consumer Advocate to conduct due diligence to ensure that consumers' interests are protected and advanced. As noted earlier, given the observation that the same entity represented all of the Sellers raises the question whether certain terms for one or any of the PPAs might have been different if they were negotiated by different entities. Based on the Commission's Order No. 36167, it appears that the Commission agrees that such 2018-0431 17
responsibilities cannot be assumed away simply because the proposed PPA is the result of a competitive bidding process.
In relevant part, the Commission stated in Order No. 36167:
[W]hile the existence of a competitive bidding process helps to provide assurances that a bid is selected "fairly," this does not act as a substitute for the commission's, or the Consumer Advocate's, independent review of the evidence in determining whether to approve, or recommend approval of, a proposed PPA. Likewise, simply because the PPA's pricing is below the PIM target set by the commission, this does not relieve, excuse, or obviate the need for the commission and the Consumer Advocate to independently review supporting materials in determining whether the PPA pricing is prudent and in the public interest.42
Notwithstanding the initial objections made by Seller, the Commission's affirmation of the need to provide relevant information to assess whether available evidence will support a finding that the proposed PPA is reasonable is a positive outcome for customers. The Commission also stated:
[D]ocumentation regarding the Project's costs and costs of the Lease Option Agreement are useful in determining the financial health and viability of the Project, potential challenges that may arise during the life of the PPA, and the reasonableness of the Lump Sum Payment to be paid under the PPA. Additionally, such information is valuable in considering the reasonableness of future similar projects. Likewise, calculations and workpapers used to determine the Lump Sum Payments are critical to understanding how the Payments are calculated, what factors were considered in determining the Payments, and assessing the overall reasonableness of the Payments.43
Pursuant to Order No. 36167, the Seller filed its responses to the Consumer Advocate's IRs regarding financial and project cost documentation and calculations, workpapers, and native files used to determine the Net Energy Potential, Lump Sum Payment, and Unit price of the proposed project on February 28, 2019.
42 Order No. 36167, at 10 - 11.
43 Order No. 36167, at 8.
2018-0431 18
However, instead of providing the native excel file of Seller's pro forma, Exhibit C, which would have allowed the Consumer Advocate to readily view the formulas used and check calculations, Seller provided a PDF copy of the table which does not allow the Consumer Advocate to view the calculations behind cells. The Consumer Advocate contends that to be truly responsive to the Commission's Order No. 36167, Seller should have provided the native excel file of the pro forma as well as any further documentation and explanations supporting the pro forma cost estimates. To Seller's credit, however, it did provide more financial information than some of the other projects. This additional information allowed the Consumer Advocate to estimate possible return on investments, which are discussed in Attachment 2.
In the limited amount of time for review and given the timing of when the information was made available and nature and format of the documents provided, the Consumer Advocate makes the following observations:
• The project characteristics in the pro forma (e.g., size of facility, production, term, unit price) appear consistent with the Application and PPA.
• While Seller provided information regarding EPC bids, the Consumer Advocate is unable to determine based on the information provided how these bids were utilized to develop the EPC costs in the pro forma model.
• Although Seller provided a copy of its Lease Option Agreement (Fourth Amendment to Option Agreement) it is difficult to the Consumer Advocate to verify how these costs were included without access to the pro forma excel worksheet in native format, with formulas intact.
2018-0431 19
• Certain calculations, such as the annual Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") were not calculated as part of the pro forma. The Consumer Advocate notes that Seller faced no obligation under the terms of the RFP to provide such information, however, such calculations would go toward assessing the financial health and viability of the Project, as referenced by the Commission in Order No. 36167 as well as addressing whether the risk transference to consumers resulting from the RDG PPA is matched by a commensurate benefit in the form of decreased returns on the projects and, ultimately, lower pricing that would be passed on to consumers.
• No other supporting documentation was offered by Sellerto explain how the seller arrived at its estimates of costs and operating expenses.
Notwithstanding that the selected projects were the result of an RFP process and that the prices do reflect a downward trend from PPA prices approved in the past, the Consumer Advocate contends that, given the nature of the RDG PPA contracts, which essentially guarantees payment as long as the capacity is available, as well as the declining price trends for renewable and storage technologies, it is important to assess whether the selected projects reflect reasonable prices with reasonable returns instead of reflecting "sticky" prices.44 Along those lines, the Consumer Advocate notes that, in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Terms, Trends, and Insights on PV Project Finance in the United States, 2018, 45 the authors offer that a general downward trend in 44 The term "sticky" prices refer the general economic observation that there are certain situations when the price of a good or service does not readily change in a reasonable time frame in response to new market information or inputs and/or recent shifts in the demand and/or supply curves.

2018-0431 20
financing costs continue and that, based on the data that they were able to obtain, the mid-case-adjusted weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") ranged from 6.6% to 9.056.46 While the Consumer Advocate believes that it is reasonable to determine what impact the risk transference to customers has had on the selected projects, the Consumer Advocate offers that the information provided by the Seller suggests that additional questions might be warranted related to a definitive determination as to whether the Lump Sum Payments appear reasonable on based on project costs.
The Consumer Advocate notes, however, that the Commission may still find the PPA pricing reasonable based on other measures such as projected system and bill savings, recent PV plus BESS project pricing, and national or regional cost studies. Finally, given the Commission's statements regarding the usefulness of project cost information in assessing the reasonableness of current project pricing and the value of future projects, the Consumer Advocate recommends that the Hawaiian Electric Companies consider requiring future developers to provide such information to the Commission and Consumer Advocate under the terms of Phase 2 RFP, including copies of the pro forma in native file format, including certain calculations such as the internal rate of return or projected return on investment, and with all calculations and formulas intact.
46 The Consumer Advocate acknowledges that there are project specific considerations that may affect the perceived risk with any particular PPA but also notes that many projects on the mainland rely on open market transactions with little guarantee as to the amount of energy that may be taken orthe stream of payments that will be received. The low-cost to high-cost WACC ranged f rom 5.1% to 7.5% for projects above $50 million.
2018-0431 21
3. Terms and Conditions of the Proposed PPA.
The Consumer Advocate notes that the terms and conditions of the proposed PPA are based on the RDG PPA issued with the Final Variable Requests for Proposals and negotiations with the Seller. The Consumer Advocate notes the various challenges with the proposed PPA, in light of the different terms and conditions introduced by the RDG PPA.
The Consumer Advocate notes that the proposed RDG PPA represents an evolution from earlier contracts, such as those that contained seniority curtailment provisions, evergreen terms, and RAP pricing, to name a few examples.
The Consumer Advocate supports the underlying reasons why the proposed RDG PPA is being used for these contracts as it eliminates some of the terms and conditions that were not in the best interest of the public. For instance, seniority curtailment, which offered developers some certainty about where their project stood in the likely dispatch queue only served to place ever increasing curtailment risk to new projects. That increasing risk ostensibly served to stifle innovation and new projects even while there was declining price trends and improvements in renewable energy technology since developers would be hesitant to enter into a contract with uncertainty surrounding the amount of energy that would be purchased on a regular basis. As a result of that uncertainty and the curtailment risk, the risk where older, higher cost projects continued to be dispatched before lower cost projects, such risk was definitely not in customers' interests.
As noted above, the proposed contracts also have fixed pricing, which is more consistent with the nature of the projects, where there is an upfront cost to build the project and little or no cost associated with the energy and other services to be delivered to the 2018-0431 22
grid. Such fixed pricing significantly reduces price volatility, which can be detrimental to customers, especially those on a fixed income or with limited means to deal with volatility that is has been observed with fossil fuel prices.
That being said, while the proposed RDG PPA does not include terms and conditions that perpetuate certain undesirable terms and conditions, it should be made clear that the proposed contract does not address all of the concerns related to earlier versions of PPA contracts. For instance, the proposed contracts are for very long terms.
Again, during times of declining price trends and improvements in technology, such long terms arguably stifle innovation since, if the needed capacity is met with long-term contracts, as technology improves and prices decline, customers are not able to receive the benefits of such market improvements if the utility is locked into long-term contracts for available capacity. In the alternative, the utility could enter into contracts but the dispatch of those less expensive and improved technology projects would still be dispatched after projects with seniority privileges.
Furthermore, the new RDG PPA are essentially capacity contracts, where even if the utility is unable to take any energy from them, as long as the capacity is available, the utility will be making payments to the seller. This represents a significant transference of risk to customers since regardless of whether there is a need for a project's capacity, customers will bear the cost of the project.
That said, the Consumer Advocate recognizes the work of the IOs throughout: (1) the procurement process in evaluating each bidders pricing in selecting the final award group as discussed above; and (2) the negotiations between the Company and Seller in reaching agreement of the other terms and conditions of the PPAs. As it relates to the 2018-0431 23
non-price terms and conditions of the proposed PPA, the IOs in the Final 10 Reports noted the following:
• Navigant stated that:
The negotiation of the PPAs was performed on a fair and consistent basis among the Finalists. Each Finalist requested changes to the PPA beyond the markup they had originally submitted. The Company resisted these changes, but did consider and compromise on some key changes requested by the Finalists in the areas of BESS performance, payment of LDs, time period for PUC approval, guaranteed Project and reporting milestone dates and delay damages. The changes are not unfair to the other Proposers not selected as Finalists and do not materially alter the risk balance between the Company and the seller as contemplated in the original model RDG PPA.47
• Bates White stated that:
It is our view that the terms of the executed PPAs are reasonable. The PPAs retain the value of the bidders' proposals to [the Company] ratepayers and were the subject of above-board negotiations, during which we observed no undue preference or treatment by [the Company].
Importantly, we observed that [the Company] retained key provisions of the PPA that protect ratepayers and require the winning bidder to perform as promised.48
4. Community Outreach and Benefits.
The Consumer Advocate notes that the Hawaiian Electric Companies submitted, as Exhibit 8 to their Applications in Docket Nos. 2018-0430, 2018-0431, 2018-0433, 2018-0434, 2018-0435, and 2018-0436, a summary of community outreach efforts and public comments.
47 Maui Variable IO Report, at 20.
48 Hawaii Variable 10 Report, at 25 and Oahu Variable 10 Report, at 27.
2018-0431
24
As set forth in Exhibit 8, there have been outreach efforts that began in 2014. It appears reasonable to assume that the outreach efforts that began in 2014 were the result of prior efforts to enter into a purchased power agreement that was the subject of Docket No. 2014-0355. In Exhibit 8, it is asserted that the Project has been discussed with "hundreds of people in individual and group meetings."49 Community outreach that started in 2014 is continuing and it is asserted that the community issues of importance are: 1) Visibility (i.e., how visible will the Project be); 2) State of Hawai'i cooperation (i.e., how the State is interested in advancing the agricultural park); and 3) Community goodwill (i.e., how Seller will be interacting and providing resources to teachers to foster renewable energy education. It appears that the majority of the of this outreach is related to the project that may be sited on "area 1 " of the Project.
50
Based on Exhibit 8, there does not appear to be any type of commitment as to a community benefits package but it does appear that Seller has committed to providing teachers with a professional development course that will facilitate "inquiry-based renewable energy education." The Consumer Advocate notes that other concessions might be forthcoming as it relates to possible commitments that will be required to acquire legal authority to construct the proposed Project. Those concessions are not discussed in Exhibit 8 and the certainty of those concessions may be dependent on whether certain efforts before the legislature is successful. Since such information is not available nor reliable at this time, the 49 Exhibit 8, at 1.
50 In Exhibit 8, there are references to area 1 but there is no definition of what area 1 might be.
2018-0431 25
Consumer Advocate does not believe that the Commission needs to consider these possible concessions at this time.
5. Other Factors.
a. Site control and allowed uses of the site.
Based on the fact that project was selected, it appears that the Seller has successfully provided evidence that it reached agreement to use the proposed site, but it appears that there may be other issues related to the ability to use the site in the proposed manner.
In the application, the project site is identified as consisting of "approximately 352 acres; part of the Project is situated on agricultural land designated by the State as State Land Use Urban and the other part is designated as Agriculture.
"51
The project site is identified as "Tax Map Key Nos. (1) 9-4-002: 052 and (1) 9-4-003: 0017
The Consumer Advocate notes that, while the application and in Exhibit 8, there is an assertion that the project site consists of land that has been designated as urban and agriculture, it is not clear whether that characterization is correct.
The Consumer Advocate used the City and County of Honolulu GIS website, http:#honolulugis.org/, which allows users to determine the zoning of land parcels, to independently verify the zoning for the land. According to the GIS website, both parcels are "AG-1" zoned lands. Pursuant to the City and County of Honolulu Revised Ordinances of Honolulu Chapter 21, the definition of AG-1 is "Restricted Agricultural", which means that the purpose of such land is "to conserve and protect important agricultural lands for the performance of agricultural functions by permitting only those 51
Application, at 15.
2018-0431 26
uses which perpetuate the retention of these lands in the production of food, feed, forage, fiber crops and horticultural plants. Only accessory agribusiness activities which meet the above intent shall be permitted in this district.
'552
It is not clear, based on the information in the record, that the proposed project site actually consists of urban and agricultural land; instead, it appears that the land is AG-1 restricted land that should be reserved for agricultural purposes.
The Consumer Advocate notes that, in response to CA/HO'OHANA-IR-3, Seller confirmed that it obtained "discretionary land use permitting clearances for half" of the project site, or approximately 138 acres and contends that permitting forthe remainder of the project area is anticipated to take more than 12 to 18 months. In response to PUC-HO'OHANA-IR-04, Seller further elaborates on the permitting for both parcels of land asserting that, for TMK 9-4-002:052, construction could potentially start by the end of 2019. For TMK 9-4-003:001, however, the same assertion is not made and may be contingent on certain other actions that may be required. In support of the proposed use of the site, Seller provided a copy of the Application for Conditional Use Permit (Minor) and Waiver Permit, dated December 2014, to its response to PUC-HO'OHANA-IR-04, which describes the intended use to develop a 19 MW solar PV system on approximately 124 acres, which generally appears consistent with the project that was proposed in Docket No. 2014-0355. In that permit application, there are assertions that the originally envisioned project is consistent with HRS section 205. Again, similar support for the proposed project site in this application is not evident.
52 Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, Chapter 21-3.50(b).
2018-0431
27
The Consumer Advocate also notes that there are ongoing efforts before the 2019
Legislative session to modify HRS § 205 to allow solar facilities on land with a productivity rating of class A ("Class A land").53 While HRS § 205 already allows certain exemptions as it relates to purposes or use other than agriculture, such exemptions are limited and generally do not apply to Class A land. The proposed legislation proposes to insert additional language that, if passed, would significantly expand the potential use of Class A land, which could include the proposed project but would also require that any solar project taking advantage of the proposed exemptions would have to meet certain requirements, such as providing water infrastructure to any service area in which agricultural production has been impacted by the solar energy facilities.
The Consumer Advocate notes that there are several entities that oppose HB 593, including, but not limited to, the Office of Planning, the Department of Agriculture, and the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center.
Based on the appearance that HB 593 may be an effort to streamline the possibility that the proposed project can proceed, if HB 593 does not pass through the legislature and is not signed into law, the viability of the project, as proposed, may be threatened.
This situation raises questions about whether the proposed project can meet milestones given that time is of the essence. Until sufficient evidence can be provided to address the concern that the proposed project may be inconsistent with current state law, the Consumer Advocate does not believe it is in the public interest for the Commission to 53 See, generally, House Bill 593 CHB 593").
2018-0431 28
grant the requested relief as it would be inappropriate for the Commission to grant approval of a project that is inconsistent with State law, county ordinances, and/or rules.
54
6. Summary.
In summary, based on the information at this time and the Consumer Advocate's expedited review, there appears to be a potential "fatal" flaw that could jeopardize the ability for the project to move forward. The Consumer Advocate recognizes that the aggressive schedule was set to meet project timelines that would enable developers to take advantage of the Federal investment tax credits that are set to start declining in 2019.
It is in recognition that time is of the essence that the Consumer Advocate has recommended disapproval at this time in order to avoid uncertainty regarding whetherthe project will be able to move forward if conditional approval was granted.
The Consumer Advocate recognizes that the proposed RFP PPAs can provide benefits by contributing to the State's goals of renewable energy, providing a contribution to the Renewable Portfolio Standard ("RPS") as set forth by HRS § 269-92(a), lower fossil fuel usage, reduction in greenhouse gases ("GHG") emissions and a hedge to fossil fuel prices as summarized on Attachment 2. Furthermore, due to the nature of the proposed PPAs as capacity type contracts, the Consumer Advocate recognizes the possible benefit of the flexibility associated with the proposed project, as facilitated by the allowed utility control pursuant to the proposed RDG PPA, as compared to an as-available project paid 54 The Consumer Advocate contemplated offering alternatives, such as conditional approval if HB 593 passes before the Commission files its decision and order in this proceeding. The Consumer Advocate is concerned, however, with the ability for the project to move forward in a timely fashion and, even if Seller is willing to take the risk of losing the full investment tax credit until it can legally move forward, the potential foregone benefits that customers would suffer as well as the potential impacts on how the capacity for phase 2 of the current RFP process might be determined, 2018-0431 29
on a per kWh basis. The Consumer Advocate is aware that the proposed contract is for a price that is lower than historical PPA prices and could place downward pressure on the Company's avoided cost. The Consumer Advocate contends that the utility should always strive to ensure that any utility resource orthird-party resource utilized by the utility is cost-effective and supportive of affordable and reliable services that do not adversely impact the utility customers but also supports advancing projects that are not inconsistent with state or county laws, ordinances, or rules. Along those lines, the utilities should stand ready to show that resources are being used to maximize the customers' benefit and not result in adverse impacts including, but not limited to, underutilized or excess capacity resources. The Consumer Advocate is also aware that there are and will continue to be technological advances or market changes that are anticipated to result in decreasing prices for renewable energy resources. The utility, in conjunction with regulators, should explore and develop the means to take advantage of those future developments without forcing consumers to bear higher bills without commensurate increases in customer value as well as providing assurances of an open market that will continue to encourage third-party interest in Hawaii's energy market.
If the Commission chooses to approve the project, however, the Consumer Advocate recommends the following:
• The Company file copies of all invoices related to the engineering, procurement, construction, and maintenance, associated with the proposed PPA no later than sixty (60) days after the Commercial Operations Date. In addition, the Company should file the Seller's income statements or results of operations related to the proposed PPA that will allow the Commission 2018-0431 30
and Consumer Advocate to evaluate the comparability of the Project's actual results to the pro forma information consistent with prior Commission decision and orders (e.g., Decision and Order No. 33541, filed on February 19, 2016, in Docket No. 2015-0224). To the extent that additional information is necessary, the Consumer Advocate reserves its right to file information requests on the Seller as a participant to the proceeding.
• As it relates to future procurement processes, the Consumer Advocate recommends that bidders be required to file the pro forma information related to their project, in the format discussed above, in addition to copies of any supporting documentation (e.g., copies of leases, EPC contracts, etc.) to support its bid price.
• Furthermore, to mitigate concerns with potential appearance of impropriety, the procurement process should be reviewed to examine and develop guidelines, as necessary, to mitigate concerns related to potential unaffiliated sellers using the same representative(s) in negotiations.
• Lastly, the Consumer Advocate notes its condition in Attachment 1, pages 15 and 17 of the statement of position as it relates to the evaluation in the procurement process.
2018-0431 31
B. WHETHER THE NON-ENERGY PAYMENTS UNDER THE PPA, INCLUDING THE LUMP SUM PAYMENTS AND RELATED REVENUE TAXES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN AND THROUGH THE PPAC, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC'S BASE RATES.
If the Commission chooses to approve the contract, as discussed above, the Consumer Advocate notes that the payments associated with the proposed PPA is similar to capacity payments. In its Final Decision and Order, filed on December 29, 2010, in Docket No. 2008-0083, the Commission approved the Company's PPAC, which would recover non-energy payments (e.g., capacity) associated with purchase power agreements. As such, it appears reasonable that the PPAC be utilized to recover the costs associated with capacity payments of the proposed PPA which Is its intended purpose. Thus, to the extent that the proposed PPA is approved by the Commission, the Consumer Advocate does not object to the inclusion of the PPA payments in the Company's PPAC, respectively, as such costs are not included in another cost recovery mechanism if the Commission decides to approve the project.
2018-0431 32
111. RECOMMENDATION.
Based upon the above, while the Consumer Advocate acknowledges that the proposed project and PPA could provide benefits to the system and to customers, for the reasons discussed above, the Consumer Advocate recommends that the Commission not approve the proposed PPA. If, however, the Commission decides to approve the proposed PPA, the Consumer Advocate recommends that the Commission, adopt the conditions discussed in Section 11.A.6 above.
