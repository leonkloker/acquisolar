The Honorable Chair and Members of the Hawai'i Public Utilities Commission 465 South King Street Kekuanao'a Building, First Floor Honolulu, Hawai'i 96813
Dear Commissioners:
Subject: Docket No. 2018-0431 -For Approval of a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation with Ho'ohana Solar 1, LLC Interconnection Requirements Amendment; Request for Approval of Overhead Line Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. ("Hawaiian Electric" or the "Company") transmits herewith the Second Amendment to Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation ("Interconnection Requirements Amendment" or "IRS Amendment"), dated February 16,2021, between the Company and Ho'ohana Solar 1, LLC ("Seller"), which is attached as Exhibit A. The IRS Amendment reflects changes to the Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation dated December 27,2018, between the Company and Seller ("PPA")1 to reflect the results of the Interconnection Requirements Study ("IRS"f for the Ho ohana Solar project ("Project").3 This letter updates the Commission on the status of the IRS and summarizes the resulting modifications made to the PPA. This letter also requests that the Commission commence review of the Company' s "Interconnection-Related Requests" (as defined below).
I. Background By application filed on December 31, 2018 in this docket ("Application"), the Company requested that the Commission, among other things, approve the PPA and an above-ground 138
kilovolt ("kV") line extension. In the Application, the Company informed the Commission that 1 Unless otherwise specified herein. capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the PPA. The PPA was previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable Dispatchable Generation dated February 1.2019, between Company and Seller.
2 A copy of the IRS. which contains confidential critical infrastructure information. is being submitted as Exhibit B pursuant to Protective Order No. 36121 issued on January 25,2019 in this docket. Exhibit I attached hereto provides the justification for the confidential treatment of the IRS.
3 The IRS Amendment substituted new versions of Attachment A (Description of Generation. Conversion and Storage Facility), Attachment B (Facility Owned by Seller), Attachment D (Consultants List). Attachment E (Single-
Line Drawing and Interface Block Diagram) Attachment F (Relay List and Trip Scheme), Attachment G (Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities), Attachment K (Guaranteed Project Milestones). Attachment K-1
(Seller's Conditions Precedent and Company Milestones), Attachment L (Reporting Milestones), Attachment N (Acceptance Test General Criteria). Attachment O (Control System Acceptance Test Criteria), Attachment T (Monthly Reporting and Dispute Resolution by Independent AF Evaluator) and Attachment U (Calculation and Adjustment ofNet Energy Potential).

the PPA had been executed prior to the completion of the IRS and that, upon completion of the IRS and acceptance of the same by Seller, the PPA would be amended to reflect such completion and acceptance.4
On January 14, 2019, the Commission issued Order No. 36068, which, among other things, bifurcated the Company' s PPA-related requests from its above-ground 138 kV line extension-related requests ("Interconnection-Related Requests"), and adopted a procedural schedule for the PPA-related requests. On March 25,2019, the Commission issued Decision and Order No. 36236 ("D&O 36236") approving the PPA-related requests, and noted that upon the Company's filing of an IRS Amendment, the Commission would issue a procedural schedule to govern its review of the Company's Interconnection-Related Requests.5
The Company is filing the IRS Amendment and IRS for informational purposes, and no action is being requested by the Commission on the IRS Amendment itself. Rather, by this filing, the Company requests that the Commission commence review of its bifurcated Interconnection-Related Requests in accordance with D&O 36236 and the Application.
II. Request for Approval of Overhead and Underground Transmission Line As noted above, in its Application, the Company indicated that subject to completion of the IRS, and the filing of the IRS Amendment based on the IRS results, the Company would request a Commission determination for construction of the proposed 138 kV line extension for the Project pursuant to Hawai'i Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง 269-27.6. To facilitate the Commission' s review, the Company has provided further information regarding the proposed line extension in Section VI, below.
III.
Non-Transmission Alternatives Attached as Exhibit A to Decision and Order No. 32052, filed April 28,2014 in Docket No. 2012-0036 (Regarding Integrated Resource Planning), is the "Commission's Inclinations on the Future of Hawaii's Electric Utilities" ("Commission' s Inelinations"). Included in the Commission' s Inclinations is the following Commission guidance with regard to transmission planning and the future development of new transmission projects on Hawai'i's grids:
New transmission projects must consider non-transmission alternatives -
New, replacement or upgrade high-voltage transmission projects generally represent significant, lumpy capital investments that will be given careful scrutiny. Non-transmission alternatives (NTAs) such as local peaking or back-up generators, energy storage, demand response and smart grid resources are technically and commercially available alternatives that must be evaluated as part 4 Sm Application, ยง IX at 17-18.

of any economic justification for new transmission system proj ects.6
The subject Project involves the construction of 138 kV interconnection facilities, paid for by Seller, which are required to interconnect the Project with the Company's grid. To the extent the Commission considers whether an NTA analysis is required, the Company notes that the above-quoted section of the Commission's Inclinations does not appear to apply to interconnection facilities that are necessary to connect a proposed renewable distributed generation resource to the grid. The interconnection facilities are necessary to accommodate the generation project, as opposed to being constructed for the purpose of alleviating an identified transmission-related constraint. Therefore, the Company respectfully requests that the evaluation ofNTAs required for transmission projects be waived for this type of project. Certain constraints introduced by the Project are proposed to be addressed through operational management of the new resource, in lieu of additional transmission infrastructure. This is described further in the IRS section below.
IV.
Status of Completion of IRS and Overview of IRS Amendment Terms As noted in Section 4 of the IRS Amendment, the IRS is not fully completed and additional IRS results will be recieved in the second quarter of 2021 and filed thereafter. The delay in completion is due to re-studies required for the System Impact Study ("SIS") since the Project has changed the transmission line to which it will be interconnecting, from Kahe-Waiau to Kahe-Halawa #1. Various components of the SIS must be redone; however, based on the Project's prior results, the Company has identified the critical parts (e. g., stability analysis and energization in rush mitigation analysis) which could have a material impact on the Facility Study due to the change in interconnection point. The energization in rush analysis has been completed, and the Company was able to complete a few iterations of the stability analysis. This partial stability analysis should be sufficient to make a determination whether Ho'ohana can connect to the Hawaiian Electric system without creating instability issues. The remainder of the stability study will be completed at a later time and should identify any tuning modifications to Project equipment settings and models for performance. Although the stability analysis is not fully complete, having the partial analysis will lower the risk of change to the Facility Study.
Notwithstanding the pending completion of the SIS, the Facility Study ("FS") of the IRS has been completed and a range for the extent of the costs for the Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities has been estimated.
Accordingly, the IRS Amendment encompasses the necessary PPA revisions to the technical attachments to the PPA. See Part VII herein for a general overview of such revisions.
Additionally, as noted previously in response to prior information requests, the Guaranteed Commercial Operations Date ("GCOD") has been extended as a result of the Parties' efforts.
While every effort was exerted by both sides to maintain the originally contemplated GCOD of 6 Commission's Inclinations at 12.

July 1, 2023,7 a short additional extension to August 31, 2023, was mutually negotiated after a careful review of the Project schedule. Further, Section 5 of the IRS Amendment provides Seller a maximum 30 day extension to this date if necessary, but is dependent on and may be limited by the Company's ability to hasten reviewing times during the design review phase. Notably, no revisions were made to the pricing provisions of the PPA and, despite the incomplete nature of the SIS portion of the IRS, Seller and the Company have agreed to accept the IRS and move forward to set the Effective Date of the PPA.
Delays in executing and filing the IRS Amendment were a result of substantive, necessary, and mutually beneficial discussion, actions, and due diligence between the Company and Seller. Three steps/events prudent to completing the IRS Amendment took substantially more time than initially anticipated - the delivery of working computer models by Seller in the original Ho'ohana SIS; negotiations necessary to relocate the 46 kV line, located on the same property as Seller's project, to more efficiently site Seller's photovoltaic panelst and mutually beneficial discussions to optimize interconnection for projects being developed in the area of Ho'ohana, as first requested by 174 Power Global ("174 PG"). The discussions to optimize the interconnection by combining separate substations contributed to a more robust and cost efficient interconnection while avoiding possible limitations on output from this Project during situations when various segments of the transmission are out of service for maintenance or due to an outage. Further details as to the items listed above were noted in PUC-HECO-IR-16 filed on January 21, 2021.
Although the items listed above have caused a delay in executing the IRS Amendment and filing this Request for Approval of Overhead Line, the Company believes that the finalized interconnection will offer three primary benefits to customers and all parties that were significant enough to pursue: 1) a more secure and reliable interconnection for dispatchable resources within close proximity to each other, 2) an additional point of interconnection for future projects in the Kunia area, and 3) by combining the switching stations of two projects into one, the overall area utilized by the projects will decrease which will result in reduced visual impacts and increased preservation of land for other valuable uses such as agriculture.
All parties are working to expedite the Project to achieve commercial operations as quickly as possible.
7 As disclosed in PUC-HECO-IR-16. July 1. 2023. was the originally contemplated extended GCOD agreed to by the Parties as a result of the negotiations to interconnect the Ho'ohana, Kupehau and Mahi solar projects into one substation.
0 As disclosed in PUC-HECO-IR-16, Company's easement for this 46kV line was subject to a one-time relocation clause at the property owner's option, the costs of which to be borne by Company. The property owner exercised this option in February 2020. Negotiations with the property owner were completed in and a working agreement completed in December 2020.

V. Interconnection Requirements Study 1. IRS Findings The objective of the IRS was to assess how the addition of the Project would influence operation of the Company's system, including identifying any issues that pose an unreasonable threat to safety, power quality, reliability, or operational efficiency, and to recommend mitigation for any associated issues. Although not fully completed, the current findings of the IRS show that it is feasible to connect the Project to the Company' s system, and that interconnection of the Project would not cause adverse impacts to the Company's system. The steady-state analysis has not been performed yet, but based on its prior results and some RFP Stage 2 results, it is estimated that the interconnection of the Project will not cause voltage violation or line section overloading on the studied Company circuits. This is true under normal circuit configuration and under multiple contingency circuit configurations. The energization study results do indicate that mitigation will be required to energize the Project plant (including the main interconnection transformer and the collector system plus step-up transformers) to mitigate the voltage dip violations. The results o f the dynamic stability analysis showed no instability caused by the Project interconnection for the contingencies that were run.
2. Interconnection of the Facility to the Company System The Seller will furnish and install the Facility described in Attachments A and B of the IRS Amendment, subject to the Seller's right to propose revisions pursuant to Section 5(f) of Attachment A.9
A preliminary single-line diagram that identifies the Point of Interconnection ("POI") is attached to the IRS Amendment as Exhibit 4 (or amended Attachment E of the PPA). The POI will be at the 138 kV voltage level of the Company's system. If it is necessary to step up the voltage at which the Seller's electric energy is delivered to the Company's system, the POI will be on the high voltage side of the step-up transformer. 10
3. Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit 6 of the IRS Amendment (amended Attachment G of the PPA), the Company will own, operate and maintain the Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities required to interconnect the Company's system with the Facility at 138 kV, up to the POI. The Seller will be responsible for designing, engineering, and constructing the majority of the Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities. The Company ' iยซ IRS Amendment.

1. Overhead Lines The scope of work for the Company's 138 kV transmission overhead line extension will span from the new 138 kV poles near the existing Kahe-Halawa #1 138kV overhead line to the Company-Owned Interconnection Facilities and consists of the installation of approximately 300
circuit feet of 2-556KCM AAC OH conductor 138 kV overhead conductor.
The Company's 138 kV overhead work is required to interconnect the Seller's Facility to the Company's 138 kV lines. Accordingly, the Company respectfully requests a Commission determination that the installation of the Company's section of 138 kV transmission lines be constructed, pursuant to HRS ยง 269-27.6. This section provides:
Construction of high-voltage electric transmission lines; overhead or underground construction.
(a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, whenever a public utility applies to the public utilities commission for approval to place, construct, erect, or otherwise build a new 46 kilovolt or greater high-voltage electric transmission system, either above or below the surface of the ground, the public utilities commission shall determine whether the electric transmission system shall be placed, constructed, erected, or built above or below the surface of the ground; provided that in its determination, the public utilities commission shall consider:
(1) Whether a benefit exists that outweighs the costs of placing the electric transmission system underground;
(2) Whether there is a governmental public policy requiring the electric transmission system to be placed, constructed, erected or built underground and the governmental agency establishing the policy commits funds for the additional costs of undergrounding;
(3) Whether any governmental agency or other parties are willing to pay for the additional costs ofundergrounding;
(4) The recommendation ofthe division of consumer advocacy of the department of commerce and consumer affairs, which shall be based on an evaluation of the factors set forth under this subsection; and (5) Any other relevant factors.
(b) In making the determination set forth in subsection (a), for new 138
kilovolt or greater high-voltage transmission systems, the public utilities commission shall evaluate and make specific findings on all of the following factors:
Hawaiian Electric PO BOX 2750, HONOLULU, HI 96840-0001
The Honorable Chair and Members ofthe Hawai'i Public Utilities Commission February 26, 2021
Page 9
(1) The amortized cost of construction over the respective usable life of an above-ground versus underground system;
(2) The amortized cost of repair over the respective usable life of an above-ground versus underground system;
(3) The risk of damage or destruction over the respective usable life of an above-ground versus an underground system;
(4) The relative safety and liability risks of an above-ground versus underground system;
(5) The electromagnetic field emission exposure from an above-
ground versus underground system;
(6) The proximity and visibility of an above-ground system to:
(A) High density population areas;
(13) Conservation and other valuable natural resource and public recreation areas;
(C) Areas of special importance to the tourism industry; and (D) Other industries particularly dependent on Hawaii's natural beauty;
(7) The length ofthe system;
(8) The breadth and depth of public sentiment with respect to an above-ground versus underground system; and (9) Any other factors that the public utilities commission deems relevant.
(c) A public utility making an application to the public utilities commission under this section shall clearly and fully state and support its evaluation of each factor set forth in subsection (b).
The requirements of HRS ยง 269-27.6(a), (b) and (c) are satisfied by this Project, as summarized below.
HRS ยง269-27.6(a)(11. The benefits, if any, of placing the overhead portion of the 138
kV line underground do not outweigh the costs. It is estimated that it would cost approximately four times more to underground this portion of the line than to construct it overhead. This is based on an estimated cost of $5,396,150 for the underground alternative versus the $1,283,243
estimated overhead. (See Exhibit D - workpapers for overhead vs underground line cost estimates.) HRS ยง 269-27.6(a)(2). The Company is unaware of any governmental public policy requiring the undergrounding of the 138 kV lines.
HRS ยง269-27.6(a)(3). The Company is unaware of any governmental agencies or other parties willing to pay for the additional costs of undergrounding the overhead line extension.

The Company has asked the Seller and the landowner, Robinson Kunia, LLC ("Robinson'), if they are willing to pay the additional costs to underground the 138 kV line, and Seller has indicated that it is not willing to do so. Robinson has not provided a response to the Company's request as of this filing. (See Exhibit E - email/letter stating Seller is not willing to pay to underground transmission line.) HRS ยง 269-27.6(a)(41 The position of the Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs will be stated upon completion of its investigation.
HRS ยง269-27.6(a)(5). There are no other "relevant factors" of which the Company is aware.
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(1). The estimated cost difference between the overhead and underground installation of the Kahe-Halawa 138 kV transmission line extension is due to the cost and installation of poles and conductors for an above ground line versus the cost and installation of ductlines and conductors for an underground line.18 The estimated initial capital cost of the overhead and underground transmission line options are summarized as follows:
Overhead Underground Initial Capital Cost $1,283,243
$5,396,150
The overhead and underground initial capital costs are shown in Exhibit D. The combined capital and operating and maintenance ("0&M") estimated rate impacts (cents/kWh) for Hawaiian Electric customers for the overhead and underground installations are as follows:
2024
2025
2026
Overhead $0.000031
$0.000031
$0.000031
Underground $0.000026
$0.000026

$26,099
$15,256
$29,813
$17,216
$4,843
$15,544
$15,668
These historical maintenance costs over the last five years show that the average 0&M costs of overhead and underground transmission lines are about the same. Please see the response to HRS ยง 269-27.6(b)(1) above for the combined capital and O&M rate and bill impacts.
HRS ยง 269-27.6(b)(3). There are tradeoffs in the reliability of underground and overhead systems. Overhead lines are subject to more frequent outages, but they tend to be of shorter duration than outages for underground lines. When faults occur in underground systems, repairs can take weeks instead of days. When lines are underground, they are not exposed to faults from insulator and shield wire failure. However, underground lines experience their own host of problems from construction, heat, and ground movement.
When developing wind pressure designs for the proposed transmission line, Hawaiian Electric follows Hawai'i Administrative Rules ("HAR") Chapter 6-73 (Installation, Operation, and Maintenance of Overhead and Underground Electrical Supply and Communication Lines), including the National Electric Safety Code, 2002 Edition ("NESC"). The formulas used to develop the wind pressures take wind effects (such as gusts, conductor drag, and terrain) into consideration. The poles and conductors would be designed to survive the anticipated wind loads of an Iniki-class hurricane. It is unlikely that the proposed poles or lines would be knocked down or cause hazards during storms (e.g., high winds, rains, hurricanes).
As for the lateral loads due to earthquakes, the City and County Building Code requires that structures be designed in accordance with the seismic design provisions of the 2006
International Building Code. The magnitude of the design loading is a function of the structure's mass, and is a site specific calculation that varies according to the characteristics of the soils onsite. Because an overhead transmission line is a flexible system generally constructed out of materials that do not have large concentrations of mass, the lateral loads are governed by the wind pressure on the exposed surface area. Accordingly, Hawaiian Electric does not anticipate a significant risk of damage to, or destruction of, the above ground transmission line due to seismic activity.

HRS 4269-27.6(b)(41. No long-term health-related impacts are expected in association with the proposed overhead line for this Project. Specifically, Hawaiian Electric's transmission lines are built and operated in accordance with numerous health and safety guidelines, including design and operation standards contained within the NESC, and worker health and safety standards determined by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA").
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(5). In February 23, Leidos published the "Kahe-Halawa 1 138kV Ho'ohana tap Reports on Magnetic Field and Electric Field Levels" study. The study provided an analysis comparing the electric and magnetic field ("EMF") levels of an overhead configuration and an underground configuration of the new transmission line which is a connector tap to the existing Hawaiian Electric Kahe-Halawa 1 circuit.
The project site is approximately 1 mile from Royal Kunia and Mililani residences. At this distance, for the proposed Ho'ohana tap lines, the B field and E field contributions solely from the taps is negligible (<0.01]nG, <<0.01 kV/m). This is due to the property of Magnetic (B) and Electric (E) fields diminishing in strength as the distance from the source increases.
The February 23, 2021 study containing Leidos's subsequent findings are included in Exhibit H.
HRS ยง 269-27.6(b)(6)(A). The Project will be located in Kunia on agricultural land. The extensions for the 138 kV transmission lines are not located near high-density population areas.
However, due to the proximity of the Project to other existing Hawaiian Electric 138kV circuits, the additional cost of undergrounding the transmission line cannot be justified.
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(6)(B). The extensions of the 138 kV transmission line are within land owned by Robinson, which is zoned for restricted agricultural (AG-1). Hawaiian Electric anticipates that the activities required for the overhead line extensions will require a Building and Land use permit and is awaiting confirmation from the Seller regarding the status of these permits. The nearest area used for public recreation is Kealohi Park, which is approximately one and a quarter miles from the nearest point on the Project site, and existing intervening structures already block the line of sight between the park and the Project site.
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(6)(C). The proposed line extensions of the 138 kV circuit are not located near any locales that might be of special importance to the tourism industry.
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(6)(D). The line extensions ofthe 138 kV transmission line and OPGW that Hawaiian Electric proposes to construct and operate would not adversely affect industries that are dependent upon Hawai'i's natural environment.
HRS ยง269-27.6(b)(71. The proposed overhead line extensions are each 300 circuit feet in length while the alternative underground route is approximately 300 circuit feet in length.
HRS 4 269-27.6(b)(81. On February 18, 2021, the Company sent a notice to Robinson detailing the overhead versus underground options and implications, see Exhibit E. On October Hawaiian Electric PO BOX 2750, HONOLULU, HI 96840-0001

10, 2018, the Seller held a community meeting with the Royal Kunia Community Association Board to go over the Project and address any questions and concerns, but the option of building overhead versus underground lines was not addressed since it was not a topic of discussion at the time. Hawaiian Electric does not expect that there is a substantial desire on the part of the community to underground the line extensions of the proposed 138 kV circuit due to the Project location and scale.
2. Public Hearing The Project involves the short extension of a 138 kV overhead line. A public hearing pursuant to HRS ยง 269-27.5 is not requested for this Project because there are no existing residential homes within or near the Project site. The zoning of the land over which the 138 kV line runs is zoned Restricted Agricultural (AG-1). The Project site and surrounding areas consist mostly of undeveloped land with overgrown vegetation. The nearest residential homes are approximately one mile away. In addition, the line extension will not be visible from the homes, due to the distance and terrain. See Exhibit C and Exhibit F for the Project location map and photographs of the Project area.

L. Attachment U A revision was made to Attachment U (Calculation and Adjustment of Net Energy Potential) to clarify the time frame in which the Net Energy Potential is measured.
VIII. Greenhouse Gas Emissions The following greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG" or "emissions") analysis is being provided for the Project pursuant to HRS ยง 269-6(b) and was performed by Hawaiian Electric's consultant, Ramboll US Consulting, Inc. ("Ramboll"). Specifically, this GHG analysis evaluates the potential GHG emissions attributed to the installation of the steel poles, overhead 138kV All Aluminum Conductor ("AAC"), and insulators.
GHG emissions analyzed include in- and out-of-state GHG emissions from: (1) production processes of the new equipment, such as component production and transportation;
(2) construction; (3) 0&M activities; and 4) removal and disposal of a portion of the existing transmission line. GHG emissions associated with Project decommissioning and disposal after the expected lifetime of the equipment (45 years) are also included. A graphical depiction of the lifecycle stages is presented below.
Upstream Stages Operations Downstream Stages r---/4 9- / ..
Raw Materials Extraction & -*Transportation -* Construction -* Use -+Decommissioning-*Transportation--0 Disposal Manufacturing -./.-
, The Project GHG emissions are based on the best reasonably available public data that has undergone scientific peer review and are also based on the most current information including emissions factors available to Ramboll at the time the analysis was completed. This information was then localized where practical, and where it may have a material impact on total GHG emissions, to account for unique location-specific factors applicable to a project in Hawai'i such as additional transportation. It is supplemented with the direct emissions calculated to account for the Project's upstream, transportation, construction, O&M, and downstream GHG emissions. The use ofa combination of localized peer-reviewed published studies and direct GHG emissions calculations for the Project represents the "GHG Analysis" approach in this GHG emissions evaluation. Based on this approach, the Company's consultant has estimated that the Project would result in an estimated 2.0 metric tons ("MT") of carbon dioxide-
equivalents ("COzeยฐ') emissions from O&M activities and 497 MT COze for the Project lifecycle.
Supporting calculations and the associated assumptions are included in Exhibit G. An Excel file, Hawaiian Electric PO BOX 2750, HONOLULU, HI 96840-0001

IX.
Conclusion Based on the foregoing, the Company respectfully requests that the Commission commence review of the Company's Interconnection-Related Requests and:
(a) Determine that the 138 kV line extension that is included as part of Company-
Owned Interconnection Facilities should be constructed, pursuant to HRS ยง 269-
27.6; and (b) Grant such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the circumstances.
