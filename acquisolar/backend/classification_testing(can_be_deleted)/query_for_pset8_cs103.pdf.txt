You are a pragmatic Solar M&A Senior Analyst in the United States. You are about to get instructions to extract information from documents. This information will be used to add meta data, create a summary and sort the documents.

Extract the following fields from the document text provided and format the response as valid JSON:
- "Document_date" in the format '3 letter month name-DD, YYYY'.
- "Document_summary" limited to a maximum of 3 sentences, tailored for a solar M&A analyst. It should state what kind of document it is, but also what its implicatoins are or what state it is in. It should assume the analyst knows about the M&A process.
- "Suggested_title" in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY max 5 word document title'. Try your best to come up with a title that is useful if you quickly want to understand what kind of document it is
- "Suggested_title_v2" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Suggested_title_v3" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Document_folder_path": Select the most suitable folder from the folder list which will be given. Follow instructions below. 
- "Document-label": "Communication", "Contract", "Amendment", "Technical Specification", "Application", "Exhibit",
- "Reasoning": Provide reasoning for every documents you classified. 

For "Document_folder_path", please follow these guidelines: 

    1. Do not create new folders. Documents must be classified based on existing categories, according to their primary content and purpose.

    2. Classify documents with precision, using these category definitions:

        "Interconnection": Contains contracts and agreements for connecting the solar project to the power grid. Look for phrases like "the interconnection customer agrees" and "interconnection requests".

        "Site Control": Includes legal documents that confirm the right to use, manage, and develop land for solar projects. This category is crucial for affirming legal authority over project sites and includes leases, purchase agreements, and easements.

        "PPA": Features power purchasing agreements between the project developer and an off-taker regarding the sale of generated solar power, detailing prices, terms, and standards, as well as supplementary documents.  

        "Environmental": Documents related to environmental impact assessments, permits, and compliance reports for the solar project. Includes studies on flora, fauna, water, soil, and air quality impacts, as well as mitigation strategies.

        "EPC": Contains contracts, plans, and documentation related to the engineering design, procurement of materials, and construction of the solar project. This includes agreements with contractors, project timelines, and construction permits.

    3. Prioritize document essence and main purpose for classification. In cases of uncertainty or documents that span multiple categories, classify according to the document's primary focus.
    4. Only classify documents as "Miscellaneous" if no other folder is likely. 
The list of to select folders from below:
  - Environmental
  - EPC
  - Interconnection
  - Permitting
  - PPA
  - Site Control
  - Miscellaneous

We need to prove that for a language L where L ⊆ f(L), that L ⊆ X. To do so, pick an arbitrary s ∈ L.
We will prove that s ∈ X. Since we know that s ∈ L, and L ⊆ f(L), we see that s ∈ X based on how we defined the language X.

We need to prove that if f is monotone, then X = f(X). To do so, we will prove that X ⊆ f(X) and f(X) ⊆ X.
First, we will show that X ⊆ f(X). To do so, choose an arbitrary s ∈ X. We need to show that s ∈ f(X).
Since s ∈ X, by the definition of X we know that there exists a language L such that s ∈ L and L ⊆ f(L), so s ∈ f(L). Based on our previous proof, we know L ⊆ X, and since f is monotone, this means f(L) ⊆ f(X).
Since we know s ∈ f(L), this means s ∈ f(X), as needed.
Second, we will show that f(X) ⊆ X. Since f is monotone, we know that f(X) ⊆ f(f(X)). Based on our previous proof, we see that if f(X) ⊆ f(f(X)), then f(X) ⊆ X, as needed.
Since X ⊆ f(X) and f(X) ⊆ X, this means that X = f(X), as required. ■ CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Winter 2024

We need to prove that if M is a monoid over an alphabet Σ, then (M †)⋆ = M. To do so, we will prove that (M †)⋆ ⊆ M and M ⊆ (M †)⋆.
First, we will show that (M †)⋆ ⊆ M. To do so, we will first prove that M † ⊆ M. Choose an arbitrary s ∈ M †. We will show that s ∈ M. Since s ∈ M †, this means that s is a codeword of M. By definition of a codeword, we know that s ∈ M, as needed. Then, since M † ⊆ M, based on our proof in Problem Set Six we know that (M †)⋆ ⊆ M, as required.
Second, we will show that M ⊆ (M †)⋆. Let P(n) be the statement "for a string s with length n, if s ∈ M, then s ∈ (M †)⋆. We will prove that P(n) holds for all n ∈ N.
For our base case, we need to prove P(0), that if the empty string is in M, then the empty string is also in (M †)⋆. By definition of a monoid, we know that ε ∈ M. By definition of the Kleene star, we know that ε ∈ (M †)⋆, as required.
For our inductive step, pick some k ∈ N and assume P(0), ..., P(k) are all true. We need to prove P(k + 1), that if a string s of length k + 1 is in M, then s ∈ (M †)⋆. To do so, consider two cases:
Case 1: s is a codeword. This means that s ∈ M †, so by definition of the Kleene star, s must be in (M †)⋆, as needed.
Case 2: s is not a codeword. Since s is not a codeword, we know that there must exist two strings x and y in M such that s = xy, and neither x nor y are the empty string. Since s has length k + 1 and both x and y have length at least equal to 1, this means that both x and y must have length between 1 and k, inclusive.
Therefore, based on our inductive hypothesis, we know that x ∈ (M †)⋆ and y ∈ (M †)⋆. Furthermore, since x ∈ (M †)⋆ and y ∈ (M †)⋆, there re natural numbers m and n such that x ∈ (M †)n and y ∈ (M †)m. This means that xy ∈ (M †)n(M †)m = (M †)n+m, meaning that s ∈ (M †)n+m. Thus, s ∈ (M †)⋆, as needed.
This shows that P(k + 1) holds, which completes the induction. ■ CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Winter 2024

Consider a language L over an alphabet Σ for which there is a TM M that satisfies these three properties:
1. For all w ∈ Σ∗. M halts on w 2. For all w ∈ Σ∗, if M accepts w, then w ∈ L 3. For all w ∈ Σ∗, if M rejects w, then w /∈ L We will prove that L is a decidable language such that there is a decider for it.
Since L has a TM M, we will show that M is a decider for L.
For M to be a decider, it must fulfill these properties:
1. For all w ∈ Σ∗. M halts on w 2. For all w ∈ Σ∗, M ∈ L if and only if M accepts w.
Let’s prove each property individually.
1. For all w ∈ Σ∗. M halts on w. We can see this is also the first property of M so that M fulfills this property of a decider.
2. For all w ∈ Σ∗, M ∈ L if and only if M accepts w.
Let’s first prove that for all w ∈ Σ∗, if M ∈ L then M accepts w. We can prove this by contradiction such that there exists a y ∈ L where M doesn’t accept y.
Since M doesn’t accept y and we know that M halts on y, it must be that M rejects y. However, the third property of M states that for all w ∈ Σ∗, if M rejects w, then w /∈ L. Therefore, M must accept y so we have reached a contradiction and if y ∈ L then M accepts y.
We also need to prove that for all w ∈ Σ∗, if M accepts w then w ∈ L. We can see that this is also one of the properties of M so we have proven this case.
We have proven each property such that M is a decider for L so that L is a decidable language. ■ CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing — Winter 2024
