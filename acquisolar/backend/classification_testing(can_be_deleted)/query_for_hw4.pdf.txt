Extract the following fields from the document text provided and format the response as valid JSON:
- "Document_date" in the format '3 letter month name-DD, YYYY'.
- "Document_summary" limited to a maximum of 3 sentences, tailored for a solar M&A analyst. It should state what kind of document it is, but also what its implicatoins are or what state it is in. It should assume the analyst knows about the M&A process.
- "Suggested_title" in the format 'MM-DD-YYYY max 5 word document title'. Try your best to come up with a title that is useful if you quickly want to understand what kind of document it is
- "Suggested_title_v2" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Suggested_title_v3" in same format as "suggested title" but with different wording
- "Document_folder_path", Choose the the folder that makes most sense from the folders below. You should specify the path to the folder from the top level folder in the format "project/sub_folder...". If you really cant find a folder that fits, put it in "project/Unclassified". Dont make up any new folders.

We use barycentic quadrature to approximate the integrals with the right-hand side. As the gradients of the basis lest functions are constant , we can easily calculate the integrals on the leftside exactly.
