Attorneys for Applicant 11. DESCRIPTION OF APPLICANT Applicant is a Hawaii not-for-profit electric cooperative, whose principal place of business is 4463 Pahe'e Street, Ste. 1, Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii 96766-2000. Applicant is 2
an operating public utility engaged in the production, transmission, distribution, purchase, and sale of electric energy on the island of Kaual, State of Hawaii. Applicant has been an operating public utility since November 1, 2002, when it purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed the operations of the Kauai Electric division of Citizens Communications Company ("Citizens"), and in connection therewith, was assigned the legislatively-granted franchise2 previously held by Citizens to manufacture, sell, furnish, and supply electric light, current, and power on the island of Kauai. Said transaction was approved by the Commission in Decision and Order No. 19658, filed on September 17,2002, as amended by Decision and Order No. 19755, filed on October 30,2002, both in Docket No. 02-0060.
Applicant is duly incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Hawaii.
111. BACKGROUND OF KAPAA SOLAR AND THE FACILITY Kapaa Solar is a manager-managed Hawaii limited liability company. Kurt Bosshard, a resident of Kauai, is the sole member and manager of Kapaa Solar. Kapaa Solar will construct and operate an approximately 1 megawattac ("MWac")3 photovoltaic generation plant (the "Facility"). The Facility's estimated annual energy production from 2011 through 2035 is as set forth in Exhibit 2, attached hereto. The Facility will be located on Lot No. 2 of the parcel of land located on Olohena Road, Kapaa, State of 2 Act 134, Sessions Laws of Hawaii 1961, as amended by Act 165, Session Laws of Hawaii 1967.
3 Note that the PPA describes the Facility in terms of its direct current (DC) peak power rating (Le, the PPA describes the Facility as a 1.1844 MWpdc photovoltaic system). In terms of alternating current (AC) capacity, the Facility's capacity is 1 MWac· In other words, taking into account losses caused by, eg, dirt on panels, output reduction due to ambient and panel temperature, conductor losses, inverter efficiency losses, etc., the 1.1844 MWPdc Facility's peak capacity will be 1 M\Nac 3
Hawaii, and more particularly identified by Tax Map Key No. (4) 4-3-003-001, as shown on Exhibit 3, attached hereto.

requested, or KIUC shall not be obligated to accept or pay for any energy delivered by Kapaa Solar and the PPA may be terminated as set forth in Appendix C of the PPA.12
F. Reactive Power: Pursuant to Appendix B of the PPA, the Facility shall maintain a continuous rated power output at the point of interconnection at a power factor within the range of between 0.95 leading and 0.95 lagging.
G Indemnification and Insurance: Kapaa Solar shall release, indemnify and hold harmless KIUC, its directors, officers, agents, and representatives against and from any and all loss, claims, actions or suits, including costs and attorney's fees resulting from, or arising out of or in any way connected with, among other things, the operation and maintenance of the Facility as well as the energy generated and delivered under the PPA to the point of interconnection.13 Kapaa Solar shall also, at its own expense and during the term of the PPA and during any other time that the Facility is interconnected with KIUC's system, secure and maintain certain types and amounts of insurance in effect with a responsible insurance company authorized to do insurance business in Hawaii, as described in more detail in the PPA.14
H. Interconnection Facilities: As indicated in the PPA, the specific terms and conditions under which Kapaa Solar's Facility will interconnect to KIUC's system will be governed by a related, but separately executed Interconnection Agreement. 15 In connection with the applicable interconnection facilities, Kapaa Solar shall pay to KIUC all amounts required under the Interconnection Agreement, in addition to the Energy 12 li, Section 12(c), at 12.

Rate described above.16 The Interconnection Agreement will also contain certain indemnity and insurance provisions similar to provisions in the PPA.
1. Conditions Precedent and Termination Rights: The Parties agreed to a number of conditions precedent in the PPA, including a provision for KIUC to timely exercise its right to seek certain approvals (e.g., approvals from the Commission, Rural Utility Service, and Cooperative Finance Corporation), or else waive certain rights to terminate the PPA.17 Additional rights to terminate the PPA are contained in Section 6 and Appendix C of the PPA, which includes, among other things, automatic termination of the PPA in the event certain sought after approvals (including Commission approval) are not received on or before twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the PPA, despite KIUC's timely and commercially reasonable efforts.18
V. REQUESTS FOR APPROVAL AND AUTHORIZATION A. APPROVAL OF PPA AND ENERGY CHARGES HRS § 269-27.2(c) provides, in relevant part, that the "rate payable by the public utility to the producer for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility shall be as agreed between the public utility and the supplier and as approved by the public utilities commission.
.19 As indicated above and stated in more detail in the 16 PPA, Section 2, at 3-4, 17 li, Section 6, at 5-6.
18 li, Appendix C of the PPA.
" HAR § 6-74-22(a) also provides that the rates for purchase shall be just and reasonable and not discriminate against Other small power producers. However, HAR § 6-74-15(b)(1) states that nothing in HAR Title 6, Chapter 74, Subchapter 3 (i.e., HAR §§ 6-74-15 to 28) "[plrohibits an electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subchapter." 7
PPA, the Parties have agreed to energy charges for the delivery of energy for sale to KIUC calculated as described in Part IV.C of this Application above. KIUC's financial models indicate that such energy charge is a reasonable rate, as it is lower than the cost KIUC could achieve through direct ownership of a photovoltaic facility. This type of energy charge has been previously approved by the Commission in other proceedings.20 The energy charges are in compliance with HRS § 269-27.2(c).21
Accordingly, KIUC contends that these energy charges are just and reasonable, and are consistent with HRS § 269-27.2 and the applicable provisions of HAR Chapter 6-74.
Furthermore, the specific terms and conditions of the PPA, as summarized above and provided in Exhibit 1, were negotiated by the Parties at arms-length and contain indemnification, insurance, and other provisions which will serve to protect KIUC and its members/customers from certain risks associated with interconnecting with Kapaa Solar's Facility. Moreover, the terms and conditions of the PPA and the Interconnection Agreement will not affect KIUC's ability to provide electric service to its 20 See In the Matter of the Application of Hawaii Electric Light Con,oany, Inc. for Approval of Power Purchase Contract with Keahole Solar Power LLC and Approval to Include the Purchase Enemy Costs in Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc.'s Enerav Cost Adiustment Clause, Docket No. 2008-0186, Decision and Order (November 28,2008), where the Commission approved a fixed rate pricing structure (with a 1.25% annual increase applied for each of the last nine years of the term) for a power purchase contract with a ten-year term. However, in the case of KIUC's PPA with Kapaa Solar, the Energy Rate will not increase for the first twenty years of the term of the PPA.
21 HRS § 269-27.2(c) states the following, in relevant part:
The commission's determination of the just and reasonable rate shall be accomplished by establishing a methodology that removes or significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels and the rate for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable utility customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost savings resulting from the use of nonfossil fuel generated electricity. As the commission deems appropriate, the just and reasonable rate for nonfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public utility by the producer may include mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments, such as adjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or other acceptable adjustment mechanisms.
8
members/customers and are not discriminatory to other small power producers that are similarly situated. For these reasons, KIUC requests Commission approval of the PPA.
KIUC also requests that the Commission find that the purchased energy charges to be paid by KIUC pursuant to the PPA are just and reasonable and that the purchased power arrangements (e.g., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which KIUC purchases energy from Kapaa Solar, are prudent and in the public interest.
B. AUTHORIZATION TO INCLUDE PURCHASED ENERGY IN ERAC HAR § 6-60-6(2) provides that "[n]0 changes in fuel and purchased energy Costs may be included in the fuel adjustment clause unless the contracts or prices for the purchase of such fuel or energy have been previously approved or filed with the commjssion." KIUC presently implements a fuel adjustment clause (aka ERAC) through its applicable rate schedules set forth in Tariff No. 1 to recover fuel and purchased energy costs previously approved by the Commission. For the same reasons discussed in Section V.A. above, KIUC also requests Commission approval to include all of the purchased energy charges (and related revenue taxes) that are incurred under the PPA with Kapaa Solar in KIUC's ERAC for the term of the PPA.
C. INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING ("IRP") CONSIDERATIONS The Commission's IRP Framework, Paragraph 111.D.5, states, in relevant part, that "[t]he integrated resource plan and program implementation schedule approved by the commission shall govern all utility expenditures for capital projects, purchased 9
power, and demand-side management programs.
„22
The Commission further elaborated on the issue of "purchased power" by stating that an IRP "is also intended to 'control, direct, or strongly influence' all power purchases.,23 The Commission further explained:
First, purchased power is itself a resource option that may be considered by a utility in fashioning an integrated resource plan.
Even if not considered in resource planning or included in an integrated resource plan, power that a utility may be required to purchase under PURPA or State statute or under this commission's or FERC's rules should be reviewed in light of the utility's integrated resource plan and contractual provisions fashioned, to the extent possible, to retain the integrity of the resource plan. Further, any power purchased must eventually be incorporated into a utility's integrated resource plan.24
KIUC's predecessor submitted its 2nd IRP in Docket No. 96-0266 and KIUC's yd IRP was filed on December 18,2008 in Docket No. 2006-0165. Neither the 2nd IRP nor the 3rd IRP specifically addresses the purchased power contemplated by KIUC pursuant to the PPA with Kapaa Solar, primarily due to the fact that, at the time such IRPs were being developed, KIUC was not aware of this project. However, the integration of solar photovoltaic energy into KIUC's system is not inconsistent with KIUC's 3rd IRP, filed in 2008, which recognizes the need for KIUC to meet its statutory Renewable Portfolio 22 The IRP Framework, formally known as A Framework for Integrated Resource Planning, originated from the Commission's proceeding in Docket No. 6617 (emphasis added). The Commission, in Docket No. 6617, conducted a proceeding to establish rules and principles that Hawaii energy utilities would follow in performing IRP. See Docket No. 6617, Decision and Order No. 11523, filed on March 12, 1992 ('Decision and Order No. 11523"), as amended by Decision and Order No. 11630, filed on May 22, 1992 ('Decision and Order No. 11630") 23 Decision and Order No, 11630, at 9.

Standard ("RPS") obligations.25 KIUC contends that the PPA with Kapaa Solar was executed to be consistent with PURPA and the State's RPS, as set forth in HRS §§ 269-91 et seq., as well as KIUC's own Strategic Plan.26 Thus, for these reasons, KIUC also requests a waiver of Paragraph 111.D.5 of the IRP Framework, to the extent necessary and applicable.27 KIUC contends that such IRP requirement would be impracticable and inappropriate to implement given the circumstances described above.
VI.
CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, Applicant hereby respectfully requests that the Commission issue a decision and order:
1. Approving the PPA, pursuant to HRS § 269-27.2, as further described above and attached hereto as Exhibit 1, 2. Finding that the purchased energy charges to be paid by KIUC pursuant to the PPA are just and reasonable;
3. Finding that the purchased power arrangements (e.g., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which KIUC purchases energy from Kapaa Solar, are prudent and in the public interest;
25 Pursuant to the Commission's Order Denying Request to Suspend Proceeding and Closing Docket filed on February 18, 2009, KIUC was ordered to suspend all activities pursuant to the IRP Framework. The Commission is treating KIUC's 3rd IRP as having the status of a plan filed with, but not approved by, the Commission. KIUC's next planning cycle will be determined by the outcome of Docket No. 2009-0108, in which the Commission is investigating proposed amendments to the IRP Framework.
26 KIUC'S Strategic Plan includes, among other things, the movement towards energy independence and decreased reljance on foreign imported on by meeting at least fifty percent (50%) of KIUC's annual electricity sales with energy generated by renewable resources by 2023.
27 See Decision and Order No. 11523 (stating, among other things, that "a utility may, at any time, request a waiver from the commission" and that the "utility seeking such a waiver will have the burden of showing, to the commission's satisfaction, that compliance with the requirement is impossible, impracticable, in appropriate, or economically infeasible").
11
5. Authorizing, pursuant to HAR § 6-60-6(2), the inclusion of all of the purchased energy charges (and related revenue taxes) to be incurred by KIUC under the PPA in KIUC's ERAC;
6. Granting a waiver of Paragraph 111.D.5 of the IRP Framework, to the extent necessary and applicable; and 7. Granting such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the circumstances.
