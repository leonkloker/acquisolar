  "Document_summary": "This document outlines a project focused on developing a machine learning model to compute the reactivity values of RNA molecules based on their sequences. By bridging the gap between RNA sequence and structure using SHAPE data, the project aims to enable the prediction of tertiary structure rapidly. Various models were deployed and evaluated, with promising results showing improvement over baseline methods.",
