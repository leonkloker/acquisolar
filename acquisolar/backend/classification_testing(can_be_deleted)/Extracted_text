M.Sc. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering. GPA 3.9/4.0
Stanford, CA University of Stuttgart October 2017 – August 2021
B.Sc. in Simulation Technology. GPA 1.3 (inverted 4.0 scale, top of the class)                       Stuttgart, Germany INTERNSHIPS Scientific ML research intern @ Ansys June 2023 – September 2023
Developed transformer models in order to time integrate solution snapshots of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in the turbulent regime as a benchmark. Also explored the intersection of Fourier Neural Operators and Transformers for Neural Operator Learning. (Tools: PyTorch, PDEs) ML research intern @ Sandia National Laboratories December 2022 – March 2023
Investigated the performance of different model architectures, such as convolutional networks or graph transformers for predicting the probability of a successful trial for of a given single-outcome quantum computation circuit. (Tools: PyTorch Geometric, Quantum Computing) RESEARCH PROJECTS Machine Learning for allergy prognosis January 2024 – now Tang Lab @ Stanford Engineering. Developing ML models such as regression and support vector machines to predict the percentage of CD63-positive basophils in an ex-vivo anti-IgE or allergen stimulated blood sample of allergic patients from the sample's Impedance Flow Cytometry data. This activation directly correlates with the severity of an allergic reaction. (Tools: ML, Sklearn, Pandas) RNA reactivity prediction September 2023 – December 2023
Course project @ CS330 Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning. Worked on sequence models such as LSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN and Transformer to predict the reactivity (SHAPE data) of each nucleotide in an RNA sequence. Trained multi-heads on top of a fine-tuned BERT-style foundation model to simultaneously predict reactivity and binding information. (Tools: PyTorch, Foundation models) Computer Vision for precision oncology December 2022 – June 2023
Integrative Imaging and Molecular Diagnostics lab @ Stanford Medicine. Built ML algorithms for automated cell segmentation and classification in digitalized cancer tissue samples to discover biomarkers that can predict response to Immunotherapy.
