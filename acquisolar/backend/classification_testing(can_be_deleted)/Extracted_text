2) v + (Ex = 0
U(x,0) = sinck) This is the inviscid Burger's equation who's characteristics are given by the initial condition (as the speedofpropagation is given by u at every time).
When thecharacteristics intersect forwards in time , the solution develops a shock, hence at the time of the shock T*, We have u #C for tat Characteristics starting atposition < are given by :
It, X(H) = (t, x + sin() t) Hence, intersections have tofulfill :
x + sincx)+ = y + sincy) + And we have T*=infi+ E(x,y) t [0(t]4 x+sin() .t =y+sincy)t,x+13
Rearranging for t gives t= - since For any fixed x, minimizing over y yields :
- 1(sin(y) -sin()) - cosly)(x -y) = 0
(sincy) = cos(y)(y -x) +sinck) => t= y(y -x) = -
sty => T* = +Ral Koscy such that T* >0
.

Thus, we have a shock occurring at T=1 and the solution is only C" for t < T*.
1) The Lax-Wendroff method can be derived by v(x, ++at) = v(, t) +at(it) + e(it) + O(at) We can substitute for the first and second temporalderivative by :
