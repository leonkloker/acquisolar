BACKGROUND On September 15, 2020, Hawaiian Electric filed an application requesting approval of a Power Purchase Agreement (UPPA") for renewable dispatchable generation with Waiawa Solar, and for approval of additional requests, relating to a 30-megawatt 1The Parties to this proceeding are HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC.
(-Hawaiian Electric" or -Applicant") and the DIVISION OF CONSUMER ADVOCACY (-Consumer Advocate"), an ex officio party to this proceeding pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (-HRS") § 269-51 and Hawaii Administrative Rules (UHAR") § 16-601-62(a).
(-MW") photovoltaic system paired with a 30 MW/240 MW-hour (UMWh") battery energy storage system (UBESS"), to be located in Pearl City and Waipio, on the island of Oahu (the -Project").2
The PPA filed in this docket is the result of the Hawaiian Electric Companies,3
second round of competitive procurement to acquire new, dispatchable and renewable energy resources for Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii Island, which has been the focus of Docket NO.
2017-0352.4
The PPA with Waiawa Solar represents one of several competitively procured, renewable dispatchable generation power purchase agreements resulting from this second round of competitive bidding.5
Collectively, these projects, if approved, would provide approximately 300 megawatts (UMW") of new renewable generation and 2See -Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.'s Application;
