11. BACKGROUND.
This Project is the result of the Company's Stage 2 RFP for Variable Renewable Generation. On August 15, 2019, the Commission approved the Company's Stage 2
Renewable and Grid Service RFPs,5 which was issued on August 22, 2019.6 Exhibit 2 to the Application provides a detailed summary of the RFP process.
The Project is consistent with the State's energy policy, which encourages the use and development of renewable energy.7 The Project will help the Company meet the State's energy policy goals by reducing the Company's reliance on fossil fuels and implementing additional renewable energy resources. Based on the analysis set forth in Exhibit 3 to the Application, it is estimated that the renewable energy supplied by the Project has the potential to displace approximately 2,908,097 barrels of fossil fuel over the term of the PPA based on a forecasted fuel consumption reduction.8
In support of this objective, Hawaii's RPS law was established by the State Legislature in 2001, and amended in 2006, 2009, and 2015. Pursuant to HRS § 269-
92(a), each electric utility company that sells electricity for consumption in Hawaii is 5 See Docket No. 2017-0352, Order No. 36474 Approving the Hawaiian Electric Companies' Proposed Final Phase 2 Requests for Proposals, with Modifications, filed August 15,2019.

8 See Application at 4-5; see also Exhibit 3 to Application, at 3.
{4840-1241-1088.} 3
required by law to establish a RPS of: (a) 10% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2010; (b) 15% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2015; (c) 30% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2020; (d) 40% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2030; (e) 70% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2040; and (f) 100% of its net electricity sales by December 31, 2045. The Project will assist the Company in satisfying these RPS goals, as further shown in Exhibit 6 to the Application.
In addition, the Commission can explicitly take into consideration the avoidance of the production of a significant amount of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions that are anticipated to be avoided during the 20-year term of the PPA as shown on Exhibit 5 to the Application, which amounts to an estimated total of up to 1 ,256,942 metric tons of GHG emissions for Project operationsand up to 1 ,078,948 metrictonsof GHG emissions per Project lifecycle.9

Pursuant to the terms of the PPA, Seller will construct a solar photovoltaic system capable of generating up to 30 MW and will consist of approximately 1 13,336 high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules mounted on single-axis trackers and twelve 2.86
MWand two 1.43 MW inverters.18 According to the Company, the Facility will be capable of generating power used by up to 18,000 homes.19
The storage component of the Facility will be comprised of an eight-hour, 30 MW, 240 MWh lithium-ion BESS that will connect directly to the photovoltaic component of the Facility.20 The BESS will charge from energy collected from the photovoltaic component of the Facility. The BESS will also have the ability to charge from energy provided by the Company's grid upon the expiration of the federal investment tax credit recapture period.21
One of the key benefits of the photovoltaic plus BESS Facility is that the Company will be able to utilize renewable energy produced by the Facility during periods of system demand outside of photovoltaic production hours. This reduces the volatility and variability of the photovoltaic energy resource, so that the Facility is semi-dispatchable.
The equipment installed at the Facility (including the inverters) will meet the Company requirements set forth in the PPA. The Facility will interconnect to the Company's existing Waiau-Mililani 46 kV and Wahiawa-Waimano 46 kV circuits.22 Seller will obtain the necessary Governmental Approvals for the construction of the Facility pursuant to the terms of the PPA. The Facility will be located north of Pearl City and east 18 See Application, at 21.

IV.
DISCUSSION.
A. The Purchased Power Arrangements are Prudent and in the Public Interest, and the Purchased Enerqv Charges are Just and Reasonable.
As discussed below, the purchased power arrangements underthe PPA, including the Lump Sum Payments to be paid to Seller, are prudent and in the public interest, with explicit consideration under HRS § 269-6.
(1) The Purchased Power Arrangements are Prudent and in the Public Interest.
The Project was selected among several competitive bid submissions and awarded the PPA through a rigorous competitive bidding process with significant oversight by the Commission and the Independent Observer.25 In accordance with the RFP and the Company's proposed schedule, the PPA was the result of arms-length 23 See Application, at 20; see also Attachment A to PPA.
24 See PPA, at § 22.2(e) and preamble.
25 „ Independent Observer" means the neutral person or entity retained by the electric utility to monitor the utility' s competitive bidding process and to advise the utility and commission on matters arising out of the competitive bidding process. State of Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, Framework for Competitive Bidding, December 8,2006, at 2.
{4840-1241-1088.} 7
negotiations between Seller and the Company from May through September 2020.
The structure of the dispatchable PPA, requiring the payment by the Company of a monthly Lump Sum Payment, allows for certainty of payment. This certainty allows the Project to be eligible for preferred underwriting criteria from financiers which, in turn, allows Sellerto offer lower pricing than would otherwise be possible underone of the prior PPA forms.
Besides offering a structure that allows for lower pricing and ultimately cost savings to ratepayers, the PPA also ensures that ratepayers are not paying for services or capacity that it is not receiving. Specifically, the PPA provides that liquidated damages will be assessed against the monthly Lump Sum Payment amount in the event the PV system or BESS is not achieving or underperforming specific performance thresholds for availability and performance.26
(2) The Purchased Energy Charges are Just, Reasonable, and in the Public Interest.
The purchased energy charges based on the Energy Price to be paid by the Company pursuant to the PPA are just, reasonable, and in the public interest. The Unit Price for the Project is fixed for the duration of the PPA and is not tied to the price of fossil fuels.
Based upon the Company's Project Benefits Analysis attached as Exhibit 3 to the Application, the Project is projected to result in energy savings to ratepayers over the term of the PPA.27 The overall projected bill impact during the term of the PPA is that a typical ratepayer consuming 500 k\Nh per month could save approximately $0.04 per 26 See Exhibit 4 to Application.
27 See Application, at 4.
{4840-1241-1088.} 8
month on average during the term of the PPA.28
In addition, the Project will provide low cost unit pricing, the opportunity to utilize available federal tax benefits, contribution to reduced reliance of fossil fuel and reduced exposure to fossil fuel price volatility, significant reduction in GHG emissions, contribution to strengthening of energy security, energy, and geographic diversification benefits, contribution to achieving the State's RPS, and increased flexibility to dispatch renewable energy resources.29
(3) The Facility Will Provide Much Needed Energy Storage on the Island of Oahu.
The Project's BESS will allow the Project to store energy from the PV system that cannot be readily accepted by the Company's grid during peak solar production. The Company will be able to dispatch energy from the Project's PV system or BESS as needed (rather than only relying on conventional generation units). The stored energy will offset night-time customer demand and assist in grid stabilization.30 The stored energy can also be used to provide black start capability which supports restoration of the grid after a system blackout.31 In addition, after the expiration of the federal investment tax credit recapture period, the Project will be capable of being grid charged, which will allow the Company to store energy from other resources on the grid to provide for greater energy supply security.32
(4) The Project Contributes to the RPS for the State of Hawaii and the Island of Oahu.
As noted in the Application, the renewable energy to be purchased from the Facility 28 See Application, at 10.
29 See HECO's Response to CA/HECO-IRA filed October 30,2020.
30 See Application, at 9.
31 See Application, at 10.
32 See Application, at 22.
{4840-1241-1088.} 9
pursuant to the PPA will assist the Company in achieving the state's RPS goals.33
Specifically, the Company expects that the Facility will contribute up to 1.61% of the Company's 2025 RPS and up to 1.23% of the Company's consolidated 2025 RPS.34
(5) The Project Provides Substantial Energy Security Benefits and Will Significantly Reduce GHG Emissions.
As shown in Exhibit 3 of the Application, the Facility is anticipated to have a substantial positive impact by decreasing the Company's future dispatch of oil-fueled units. Based on the Company's analysis in Exhibit 3 of the Application, it is estimated that the renewable energy supplied by the Project may displace up to 2,908,097 barrels of fuel overthe term of the PPA based on a forecasted fuel consumption reduction.35 This will result in a decreased reliance on imported oil resulting in an increase in local economic development and reducing the potential negative economic impacts of oil price fluctuations which have been significant.36 The Company has indicated that in the past ten years, its Low Sulfur Fuel Oil prices have fluctuated between $35 per barrel to $146
per barrel.37 The Project will reduce ratepayers' exposure to such fossil fuel price volatility by supplying renewable energy at a fixed price.
Based on the Company's analysis in Exhibit 5 of the Application, the Project will significantly reduce GHG emissions. It is estimated that the approval and completion of the Project will result in a net GHG emissions reduction of 1 ,256,942 metric tons per Project operations and 1 ,078,948 metric tons per Project lifecycle.38
Accordingly, the project is prudent and in the public interest, with explicit 33 See Application, at 4.
34 See Exhibit 6 to Application.
35 See Exhibit 3 to Application; see also Application, at 5.
36 See Application, at 15.

consideration under HRS § 269-6.39 The project will help to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels, reduce price volatility, reduce the export of funds for fuel imports, reduce fuel supply reliability risk, and reduce GHG emissions.
(6) The Project is Supported by the Local Community.
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the RFP, Seller has developed a community outreach and communications plan to work with and inform neighboring communities and stakeholders about the Project and to gain support of the Project. To that end, Seller has established a Project website and dedicated email address to receive and respond to comments and feedback received from the community.40 Seller conducted a public meeting in the community where the proposed Project is located to gather stakeholders and other interested parties in the area to apprise the community regarding the Project, and to allow an opportunity for community concerns and questions to be raised.41 Attached as Exhibit 8 to the Application are copies of public comments from Seller's community outreach efforts, as well as a summary of Seller's community outreach efforts prior to the filing of the Application ("Community Outreach Report").
Seller is not aware of any significant community opposition and believes that there is community support based upon the feedback received from the community meeting, 39 HRS § 269-6(b) provides:
The public utilities commission shall consider the need to reduce the State's reliance on fossil fuels through energy efficiency and increased renewable enemy generation in exercising its authority and duties under this chapter. In making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs of utility system capital improvements and operations, the commission shall explicitly consider, quantitativelv or qualitativelv, the effect of the State's reliance on fossil fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, fuel supply reliabilitv risk, and greenhouse las emissions. The commission may determine that short-
term costs or direct costs that are higher than alternatives relying more heavily on fossil fuels are reasonable, considering the impacts resulting from the use of fossil fuels.

email(s), and other direct outreach.42
Seller is committed to fulfilling its community outreach and communications plan, gathering feedback on an ongoing basis throughout the Project process, making reasonable efforts to address potential issues of concern as they arise, and maintaining community support as the Project continues.43 In accordance with the terms of the PPA, Seller has begun the process to solicit public comments a second time and will file the additional written comments with the Commission no laterthan the filing of the Company's Reply Statement of Position.44 Further, Seller has and will continue to provide Project information and collect feedback on an ongoing basis through various methods which include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Conducting Community Meeting(s);
• Issuance of Community Meeting Notices;
• Media outreach;
• Advertising;

B. Anv Suggestion of Concerns of Improprietv is Unsupported.
The Consumer Advocate has inquired by way of information requests whether the IO or Company had any concerns that sellers were represented by the same attorney and/or law firm during the evaluation and selection process.46 The Company expressly stated that it "has no indication that there was any collusion in the bid preparation process or PPA negotiations through such shared counsel."47 The Company also confirmed that the IO did not discuss any concerns that multiple projects were represented by the same counsel, which is likewise reflected in the IO Report, filed October 21, 2020.48
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the RFP, Seller's outside counsel have provided written certifications to the Company certifying that they would not share a proposer's confidential information or the Company's confidential information associated with such proposer with third parties unaffiliated with the proposer.49 The Company stated that it has no indication of any collusion in the bid preparation processor PPA negotiations through such shared counsel.50
C. Approval of the Above-Ground 46 kV Line Extension, if Necessary.
If necessary, upon completion of an IRS for the Project, the Interconnection Requirements Amendment, and the filing of such additional information as may be necessary in connection with the requested approval of the above-ground 46 kV line extension, Seller requests that the Commission find that the above-ground 46 kV line 46 See CA/HECO-IR-28, filed November 4,2020.
