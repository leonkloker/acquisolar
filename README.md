## Summary Sprint 1

Magnus: 
* Accomplished in Sprint 1: Interviewed potential users, acquired data to work with, did a bit of work on the backend but Leon carried that part.
* Plan for Sprint 2:

Leon:
* Accomplished in Sprint 1: Market research in Solar M&A and research on existing intelligent search engines. Worked on the backend using LlamaIndex, i.e. the document indexing and retrieval system as well as the response generation.
* Plan for Sprint 2: Properly connect backend to the frontend, also try to incorporate re-ranking functionality to the document retrieval mechanism and exploring the usage of Vectara (an existing RAG service) as a backend. Helping Zara to improve the UI. Continue doing market research by conduting interviews with the goal of finding some actionable paint points in the solar M&A process such that we can build a solution around that (working on product-market fit).

JÃ¼rgen:
* Accomplished in Sprint 1: Talked to engineers about architecture best-practice, attend "Create Embeddings on Real-Time Data with OpenAI", experiment with having Anthropic and OpenAI fill out the checklist based on documentation provided (failed), created BasePrompt
* Plan for Sprint 2: 1) Implement base prompt; 2) Create an evaluation system to test changes to prompting in qualitative performance & accuracy
