EXHIBIT E PAGE 1 OF 9 October 21, 2022 VIA EMAIL Mr. Jason Smith Kupono Solar, LLC 400 East Van Buren Street, Suite 350 Phoenix, AZ 85004 Dear Mr. Smith, Subject: Kupono Solar - 46kV Line Extension Ouery for the Cost to Underground Dear Mr. Smith, In connection with the development and construction of a new photovoltaic plus battery electric generation facility (the"Project") on land owned by the United States Navy, the Project involves the extension of the  46kV circuit. New lines will be installed to connect to the Kupono Solar facility in Ewa, Oahu and the scope of work involves the removal of one (1) existing pole and installation of two (2) new poles and approximately 300 feet of subtransmission lines. Please see attached drawing for an approximate depiction of the new poles and lines. The intent is for the new lines to be constructed above ground. Constructing these lines underground would cost considerably more than constructing the line above ground as planned. The estimated cost for the overhead sub-transmission line for the Project is $276,270. The estimated cost for the underground sub-transmission line alternative is $585,000. The underground route would follow the same route as the proposed overhead line extension. The construction of the new lines requires approval by the State of Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (the "PUC"). In reviewing whether to approve the construction of the new electrical lines, the PUC is required to consider several matters, including, in accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes §269-27.6(a)(3), "whether any government agency or other parties are willing to pay for the additional costs of undergrounding" the new electrical lines for the Project. This letter is to inquire whether Kupono Solar, LLC would be interested in paying the cost differential between the planned overhead lines and the underground alternative. It is not a request or requirement to incur such costs but only an inquiry as required by the statute. Accordingly, please notify Hawaiian Electric by November 20,2022, if Kupono Solar, LLC is interested in paying the additional costs of undergrounding these new sub-transmission lines as described above.

A Community Meeting was held in July of 2020 in support of the project. Since that time Bright Canyon Energy Corporation ("BCE"), and Ameresco, Inc. ("Ameresco") have formed a joint development agreement to jointly develop, construct, own and operate KOpono Solar. KOpono Solar will consist of 42 MW of renewable solar energy, with a four-hour battery storage system to provide solar after sunset. The project is proposed for construction on approximately 128 acres, down from an original 160 acres, of underutilized lands within the Navy West Loch Annex of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam OBPHH). We are driven by the core values of trust, integrity, respect, accountability and safety. We are committed to entering the Hawaii community with these same guiding principles. The project's community engagement is a cornerstone of the development process. Community stakeholders will be in-the-loop and consulted routinely at every step. Community members will be encouraged to submit questions and comments. Outreach will occur on a regular basis and be supplemented if it is determined needed. We began meeting with community members and stakeholders upon identifying the opportunity and before submitting the RFP response. We will continue the work through the Hawaiian Electric selection process, negotiations, and subsequent steps. This report outlines the community outreach work done since the initial interest in the project in early 2019 until now. Also included in this report are exhibits that further illuminate the outreach done to date, including: • 1<Opono Solar website launched in May 2020 and revised to reflect the joint development and project updates in December 2021 • KOpono Solar Project Summary and Community Outreach Plan, updated in December 2021 EXHIBIT G PAGE 2 OF 73 • The Media Alert distributed to key media outlets in the state, June 8,2020 • Tear sheets from multiple ads placed in the Star Advertiser and Midweek, early June 2020, and again as a reminder immediately prior to the meeting • The July 2020 1<Opono Solar Virtual Community Meeting participant registrations and data on those who participated in real-time • Questions, comments, and responses submitted during the community meeting, prior and subsequent via emails and website queries. • Email communication from KOpono Solar to all interested parties reminding them of the thirty-day comment period, August 2020 • Tear sheets from multiple ads placed in the Honolulu Star Advertiser, late April and again as a reminder immediately prior to the meeting in early May 2022 • Presentation to the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board on May 12, 2022 • Public Community Meeting on May 13, 2022 • Project update presentation to the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board on September 9, 2022 • Attendance at a Town Hall meeting in Ewa hosted by state Senator Kurt Fevella on September 15, 2022 Initial Outreach 1<Opono Solar understands the importance of community engagement in a successful project. We engaged community professionals early in the process to meet with stakeholders and community leaders and provide information about us, the project, and the benefits it brings. The project is located on Navy land sequestered from the surrounding communities. However, we felt it extremely important to reach out to the civilian neighbors and solicit their comments and questions as to their impressions and as beneficiaries of the renewable energy produced. Our outreach also included consultation with federal, specifically DON stakeholders because the land is under control by the Navy Department of Defense. Those stakeholders include: • Commanding Officer and Leadership Team • NAVFAC PACIFIC • NAVFAC HI EV • Navy Region School Liaison • Public Affairs • Public Information Officer • Social Communications • Morale Welfare Recreation Office EXHIBIT G PAGE 3 OF 73 Within the surrounding community, we have sought input from numerous stakeholders and will be seeking input from others, including: • Ewa Neighborhood Board • Community Associations • The Governor's Office • Hawail State Energy Office • City and County of Honolulu Mayor's Office • Hawai'i Congressional Delegation • Elected officials, such as o Senate President Kouchi o Senator Gabbard (Chair, Agriculture and Environment Committee, Neighboring District) o Senator Wakai (Chair, Energy and Economic Development and Tourism Committee) o Senator Dela Cruz (Chair, Ways and Means) o Senator Kidani (Senate Vice President, Chair Education Committee, Neighboring District) o Senator Fevella (District Senator) o Representative Lowen (Chair, Energy and Environmental Protection) o Representative McDermott (Neighboring District House Representative) o Representative Cullen (Chair, Legislative Management, District House Representative) o Representative Cachola (District House Representative) o Representative Har (Neighboring District House Representative) o Representative.Johanson (Majority Leader, Pearl Harbor Neighboring District House Representative) o Representative Ichiyama (Pearl Harbor Neighboring District House Representative) o Council Member Menor (City and County of Honolulu Council Member of District) Those discussions were met with enthusiasm about the project in this area and the renewable energy benefits it will bring. They were unanimous in their view that solar is a critical element to the state's energy future, saying things like "We need more solar and we need it now." Stakeholders also shared thoughtful information with us about these communities, including traffic congestion concerns, recommending that we engage early and often to keep the community informed. EXHIBIT G PAGE 4 OF 73 Outreach Upon Being Short-Listed by Hawaiian Electric Company While we had planned to continue in-person meetings with community groups, neighborhood boards, and other stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic required all of us to change course and go virtual. We launched kuponosolar.com in May 2020, including detailed information about the project, its benefits, its location, permitting, cultural studies, the community outreach work associated with the project, and a detailed list of frequently asked questions. We also utilize the site as the portal to inform community members about upcoming events, encourage them to register to attend the virtual events, ask questions or provide comments, and opt-in for email updates. The website was updated in December 2021 to reflect the joint development and project updates. Also within the website is the detailed Community Outreach Plan (See Appendix A), designed to specifications set forth by Hawaiian Electric Company. Our media alert was sent to local outlets on June 8,2020. Advertisements appeared in the Star Advertiser and in Midweek announcing our July 9 public meeting with a 30-day notice and a follow up ad was also placed in the Star Advertiser on July 8 reminding stakeholders of the meeting (See Appendix B). A banner announcement on our website also announced the meeting throughout the month of June encouraging people to register. Thirty-six people registered to attend the meeting, and the unique view and stream total data confirms that it was well-attended. Attendees in the virtual meeting included union representatives, Hawaiian Electric personnel, and community members, all of whom were engaged and informed about solar energy. The questions posed were in line with those asked of many other photovoltaic projects - addressing construction disruption, requesting information about security and fencing, asking questions about PV and how it works, questions about cultural resources, and the impact on electricity pricing in Hawai'i (See Appendix C). We responded to questions in real-time during the presentation and then followed up via email with others that were filed through the website or email. This community is engaged and informed and appears to be satisfied with the planned project and excited about the energy benefits it will bring. Virtually all the questions asked are also answered on the website and within the Community Outreach Plan (See Appendix C). EXHIBIT G PAGE 5 OF 73 Outreach following the filing of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) In April of 2022 we announced a second community meeting to take place on May 13, 2022. We placed two advertisements announcing the meeting in the Honolulu Star Advertiser, the first on April 29,2022, two weeks before the meeting, and again on May 11, 2022, two days before the meeting (See Appendix B). A meeting announcement was also placed on the project website at https://www.kuponosolar.com/community/default.aspx. On May 12, 2022, we presented to the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board at a regularly scheduled meeting. A recording of the meeting is available at: https://archive-media 2.gra nicus.com/On Dema nd/olelo/olelo 69eb937f-bb8c-425d-9bf5a8859511c533.mp4. The project presentation starts at about the 46-minute mark. No transcription of the meeting was made by the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board. A copy of the oral questions and chat comments is attached (See Appendix D). On May 13, 2022, a community meeting was held at the Holomua Elementary School Cafeteria. This meeting was conducted as an open house event with a number of display boards for members of the community to review at their own pace. We had representatives from Kupono Solar, our environmental contractor Tetra Tech, our cultural resource contractor ASM Affiliates, along with supporting staff from the Anthology Marketing Group. Copies of the sign-in sheets and written comments received via comment forms is attached (See Appendix E). On September 8,2022, we provided an update to the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board regarding the approval of the PPA, schedule updates, community benefits update, and our planned attendance at a Town Hall meeting in Ewa on September 15, 2022, hosted by State Senator Kurt Fevella. A recording of the Ewa Neighborhood Board meeting is available at: https://archive-media 2.gra nicus.com/On Dema nd/olelo/olelo ff6cb981-43e7-4a76-91aee33325fe8427.mp4. The project update starts at about the 1 hour 5-minute mark. No transcription of the meeting was made by the Ewa Beach Neighborhood Board. Members of the development team attended a Town Hall meeting hosted by state Senator Kurt Fevella on September 15, 2022. On October 7,2022, we hosted a groundbreaking ceremony on the project site. The groundbreaking was well attended by a broad base of stakeholders in the community including Congressional delegates, Navy, state and local policy makers, department heads, community members, unions, businesses and non-profits. Approximately 77 people attended the ceremony. EXHIBIT G PAGE 6 OF 73 Email Questions & Comments In addition to questions and comments received during the virtual meetings several emails were received. Emails received and our responses to the emails have been compiled as an attachment (Appendix F). Moving Forward We will continue to engage the community through meetings, emails, telephone, and other formats as needed. The community response has been positive. They overwhelmingly recognize the need for utility-scale solar and storage systems in Hawai'i and are increasingly more informed about how it will impact the state. There have been no adverse reactions or concerns - only questions about logistics (traffic and fencing), timing, technical questions about equipment, Pueo, cultural resources, community benefits and decommissioning the project at the end of the contract.

Impacts to biological resources or cultural resources are not anticipated, as no sensitive resources are expected to be present within the proposed project area. Shortterm construction impacts include those related to increased dust, erosion and noise, which will have mitigation efforts. The related actions in the project vicinity are expected to result in similar types of impacts. Measures would be implemented to avoid and minimize project-related construction impacts; it is expected that the other recent and planned projects in the area include similar measures to minimize and mitigate potential impacts. It is not expected that these temporary construction-related impacts associated with the proposed project would combine with those of other projects in the vicinity to create substantial adverse cumulative impacts. The proposed project is not expected to result in any significant cumulative impacts when considered with other known past, present and foreseeable future actions. The proposed project would not lead to secondary or indirect changes to land use and development on 0'ahu as it is consistent with community plan vision, policies, and principles, and no changes to land use or zoning would be required. EXHIBIT G PAGE 14 OF 73 CULTURAL RESOURCE IMPACTS Proposer's updated Commun ity Outreach Plan must include a plan that (1) identifies any cultural, historic or natural resources that will be impacted by the project (2) describes the potential impacts on these resources and 3) identifies measures to mitigate such impacts.

This research included an archival review of existing historic presen/ation reports and historical maps, as well as a review of traditional cultural information relative to the current study area. Futher activities will be conducted to include field inspections & consultation interviews. 7 Extensive modern-day studies have been conducted in the area, beginning in 1977 through 2017, as parts of larger study areas associated with both former U.S. Naval activities and an earlier proposed solar development project. The collective results of these studies report that the bulk, but not all, of the current proposed project areas have been investigated for the presence of archaeological sites. The proposed site underwent an archaeological study in 2015, including surface survey and subservice testing. No traditional Hawaiian sites were identified. It was concluded that the extensive use of the land during historic and modern times destroyed any earlier sites that may have been present. Six historic period sites were discovered and recorded, but none were evaluated as significant. EXHIBIT G PAGE 15 OF 73 Outreach COMMUNITY OUTREACH Detailed Community KI]pono Solar understands the importance of community engagement and outreach. We listen first, and then we act-with integrity, intention and transparency. It's our commitment to the community to engage thoroughly, listen with intent, provide information transparently, mitigate concerns and be a good, quiet neighbor. We meet with stakeholders personally, one-on-one and in group settings, to understand what information they need from us, what concerns them, and take action to do what we can to support them. We do our due diligence to know a community's character and priorities-from traffic to cost of living-and we do everything we can to address the concerns. We look closely at the project from the community's perspective and take the lead to mitigate any potential concerns early. The project js sited on Navy land. Our outreach will include both the Pearl Harbor-Hickam community and the broader 0'ahu community, with focus on those areas closest to the project. Kapono Solar has identified and will continue to reach out to the following stakeholders and will be updating this list: • State officials and offices, including the Office of the Governor, Department of Business and Economic Development and Tourism, Energy Office, Hawal's Congressional delegation, and others • Elected officials, including members of the state Legislature representing the region as well as those in key committee and leadership positions • City and County of Honolulu officials, including the Office of the Mayor, elected officials and the Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency • Neighborhood Board • Neighborhood and Community Associations • Nonprofits servicing the region • Local businesses • Native Hawaiian organizations and individuals • Schools • Churches • Individuals within the community • Department of the Navy and Joint Base Pearl HarborHickam personnel EXHIBIT G PAGE 16 OF 73 Detailed Community Outreach Plan (cont.) Our outreach work focuses on sharing project detailslocation, size, technologies, acreage, the needs being fulfilled, project benefits, project permitting, cultural impact and environmental impact. Our goal is to engage the community in understanding the project and its value, and then listen to their thoughts and concerns so that we can factor that into its development and operations. Outreach methods include but are not limited to the following: • Website • One-on-one personal meetings • Participation in existing gatherings, such as Neighborhood Boards and Community Associations • Proactive project-specific meetings with community groups and interested individuals • Media outreach, including meeting announcements and other information • Email • Ongoing updates to community stakeholders and leadership • Creation and distribution of collateral materials explaining the project and updating stakeholders on its progress (e.g. FAQ, brochure, PowerPoint, presentations and poster boards) Community members are offered multiple ways to communicate with Kopono Solar about the project and have those comments memorialized for the record, including the following: • In-person or virtual town hall meetings • Email • Online submissions via the website • Formal 30-day comment periods prior to and during the PUC process and environmental permitting processes EXHIBIT G PAGE 17 OF 73 Oppositio Local Community Support or Efforts begun in 2019 found significant support for the project and an understanding of its benefits to the community and to the state's energy initiatives. Comments received included these statements: • "We need more renewable energy and we need it now." • "This project will bring much needed benefits to the state." • "The surrounding neighborhoods will benefit from the project's energy production and the additional security to the area provided by the project." • "Traffic choke-points in the area may create frustrations that will need to be addressed." Community leaders are engaged and ready to see the state move ahead on its goals. While Kopono Solar didn't receive any messages of clear opposition, we did receive relevant and important questions from the community about timing of the project and requests that the developer remain cognizant of ground-level impacts on issues like traffic and take pro-active action to mitigate any impact. Community Outreach Efforts We began outreach to these stakeholders in 2019. Our outreach efforts are iterative, with conversations with various groups leading to others not already on our list. We document these discussions to ensure that thoughts, concerns, suggestions and recommendations are all captured so they can inform our ongoing work. Key stakeholders with whom Kopono Solar has already engaged with and will continue to on an ongoing basis include but are not limited to the following: • State officials and offices, including the Office of the Governor, Department of Business and Economic Development and Tourism, Energy Office, Hawai'i's Congressional delegation, and others • Elected officials, including members of the state Legislature representing the region as well as those in key committee and leadership positions • City and County of Honolulu officials, includingthe Office of the Mayor, elected officials and the Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency • Local businesses • Individuals within the community • Department of the Navy and Joint Base Pearl HarborHickam personnel EXHIBIT G PAGE 18 OF 73 Community B The project aligns with numerous critical goals and mandates in Hawai'i, including the following: • The state's energy goals of 100% renewable electricity by 2045 • The state's carbon neutral goal by 2045 Benefits to the wider island community also include the following: • Stable cost of energy for the benefit of 0'ahu utility customers • Construction and other project-related jobs and ongoing local operations employment • Sourcing of supplies and materials from in-state providers • Economic boost to local businesses • Battery energy storage enabling solar after sunset Kopono Solar is committed to identifying, through stakeholder input, impactful ways to benefit the local community so that support can be provided in areas such as, community organizations, charities, Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) education and youth sports.

SUBSCRIBE: Ar*gdomistr 538-NEWS Stal·-Aclvet·User staff Researchers at the liniversity of Hawaii have recently focused on an exotic area of the sun called the corona. and have shed light on the sun's powerful niagnetic field. This work has implications on Earth. The socalled solar wind - fast-moving. high-energy particles - whack Earth's magnetic field and periodically produce power outages UH Institute lor Astronomy graduate student Beltiamin Boe conducted a new study that used total solar eclipse observations to measure the shape of the coronal magnetic field with higher spatial resolution and over a larger area than ever before. The results were published June 3 in the Astrophysical Journal. Boe was advised by UH-Manoa astronomy professor Shadia Hat)bal. who has le,1 a group of eclipse chasers. the Solar Wind Sherpas, making scientific observations during solar eclipses toi· more than 2() years. These observations have led to breakthroughs in unveiling some of the secrets of the physical pr cesses defining the corona. "The corona has been ol> served with total solar eclipses for over a century, but never before had eclipse Images been used to quantify its magnetic field structure." Boe said in a release. "1 knew it would he possible to extract a lot more information by applying modern image processing techniques to solar eclipse data." Boe traced the pattern of the distribution of magnetic fiek! lines in the corona. using an automatic tracing method applied to images 01 the corona taken during 14 eclipses during the past two decades. This data provided the chance to study changes over two 11-year magnetic cycles of the sun. Boe found that there were very fine-scale structures throughout the corona. Higher-resolution images showed smaller-scale structures, implying that the corona is even more structured than previously reported. To quantify these changes, Boe measured the magnetic field angle relative to the sun's surface, [)u zinw periods of minimum solar activity, the corona's field emanated almost straight out of the sun near the equator and poles, while it came out at a variety of angles at midlatitudes. During petiods of maximuni solar activity. the coronal magnetic field was far less organized and more radial. "These results... indicate that the leading ideas for how to model the formation of the solar wind are not complete, and so our ability to predict and defend against space weather can be improved," Boe said. When the solar wind hits Earth, Earth's magnetic field deflects the energy to the poles, creating the aurora borealis - the northern lights -and the equivalent in the south, the aurora australis. Solar research is vital to any future settlement on the moon. which has no strong magnetic tield. During a solar storm or flare. settlers would have to be indoors or woukl experience 1-adiation sickness.

Lawmakers must reach agreement and pass at least one of the measures today, the deadline for fiscal bills.

A9 + UKRAINE UNDER SIEGE Biden seeks $33B in military, humanitarian aid By Peter Baker and Michael Levenson New York Times WASHINGTON » President Joe Biden signaled a vast increase in the United States' commitment to defeating Russia in Ukraine on Thursday as he asked Congress to authorize $33 billion for more artillery, anti-tank weapons and other hardware as well as economic and humanitarian aid. The request represented an extraordinary escalation in U.S. investment in the war, more than tripling the total emergency expenditures and putting the United States on track to spend as much this year helping the Ukrainians as it did on average each year fighting its own war in Afghanistan, or more. "The cost of this fight is not cheap," Biden said at the White House. "But caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and Please see I.*RAINE, A9 lmE >> Ukrainian capital attacked as Russia intensifies bombardment.

Sylvia Luke (D. Punchbowl-Pauoa-Nuuanu) said at Thursday's joint House and Senate conference committee meeting. Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole (D, Kailua-Kaneohe), cochair of the legislative Native Hawaiian Caucus, said he was extremely gratefu] and humbled to be at the table in the state Capitol for the committee's unanimous vote. "It's an amazing feeling to be in the room for this,- he said. "This is a historic moment," added Rep. Stacelynn Eli (D. Kalaeloa-Ko OlinaMaili), whose district has an abundance of Hawaiian cornmunity members and DHHL subdivisions. "This is something that Native Hawaiians have been waiting for for a long time." Thursday's key vote came two days after another committee of lawmakers approved $328 million to settle a 23-year-old lawsuit and compensate about 2,700 DHHL beneficiary plaintiffs who didn't receive homestead land leases in a timely manner, including about 950 descendants of plaintiffs who died while the case against the state was being litigated. Rep. Gene Ward (R, Hawaii Kai-Kalama Valley) noted that the two contributions amount to nearly $1 billion. "That's real change," he said. "That's real history." Since the state inherited UKRAINE Continued hum Al aggression in Ukraine." Biden also sent Congress a plan to increase the government's power to seize luxury yachts, aircraft, bank accounts and other assets of Russian oligarchs tied to President Vladimir Putin and use the proceeds to help the Ukrainians. Just hours later Congress passed legislation allowing Biden to use a World War [I-era law to supply weapons to Ukraine on loan quickly. The latest U.S. pledge came as Moscow raised the prospect of a widening conflict with the West. Russian officials accused the United States and Poland of working together on a covert plan to establish control over western Ukraine and asserted that the West was encouraging Ukraine to launch strikes inside Russia, where gas depots and a missile factory have burned or been attacked in recent days. A Russian missile strike setting off a fiery explosion in central Kyiv shattered weeks of calm in the capital and served as a vivid reminder that the violence in Ukraine has not shifted the homestead program in 1959, after it was created by Congress in 1921 under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to compensate for the government's history of taking Hawaiian land, a waitlist for homesteads has grown to include about 28,700 applicants. Beneficiaries of DHHL have to be at least 50% Hawaiian and can receive lots with 99-year leases that cost $1 a year, though they have to pay to build their own home. DHHL which has about 9,980 lot lessees, has struggled with delivering anywhere close to enough homesteads because of historically low funding and high infrastructure development costs on its land, which is largely outside urban areas. The agency estimates it would cost at least $6 billion to develop lots on its land for all beneficiaries, based on a conservative per-lot estimate of over $150,000. With $488 million, DHHL projects it can develop 2,910 homestead lots at 11 existing projects on Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Hawaii island and Kauai by 2028. The biggest planned addition would deliver 1.255 lots in East Kapolei for $107 million. DHHL's smallest anticipated residential lot delivery in the mix is 58 lots on Mob kai for $30 million. Also on the funding list in the bill are 25 pasture lots in Kau on Hawaii island that would cost $40 million including a water system, and 40 lots for subsistence agrk culture in Honomu on Hawaii island for $2 million. The idea to provide exclusively to the eastern and southern portions of the country, where Russia is now focusing its efforts to seize and control territory. Russian forces are making "slow and uneven" progress in that part of Ukraine but are struggling to overcome the same supply line problems that hampered their initial offensive, the Pentagon said. The strike came on the same day that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine was meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres just a few miles away in Kyiv, a visit that was no secret in Moscow. Guterres arrived in Ukraine after sitting down with Putin in Moscow in hopes of securing evacuation routes for besieged Ukrainian civilians and support for the prosecution of war crimes. In the hours before the latest strike. Guterres toured the stunning wreckage in Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin, three suburbs of Kylv that have borne the heavy cost of the fighting. Standing in front of a row of scorched buildings where dozens of people were killed, he called Russia's invasion "an absurdity" and said, 9'here is no way a war can be acceptable in the 21st century." $112 million for distribution to beneficiaries on the waitlist was produced in the Senate after discussions with DHHL about how many homesteads the agency could deliver in the next several years. At Thursday's committee meeting, House negotiators basically agreed to this idea. which could allow beneficiaries to waive a homestead award in exchange for up to $100,000 if used to help buy a home not on DHHL land, or even to pay down a mortgage on a home they own outside a DHHL subdivision. The payment, Luke added, also could be used for rent. One provision the committee added to the bill Thursday is for unencumbernd funding to lapse at the end of three years. That might or might not reduce the number of homesteads DHHL delivers with the appropriation in HB 2511, given the agency's estimate for developing 2,910 homesteads by 2028. William J. Aila Jr., DHHL director, expressed thanks Thursday to members of the conference committee and acknowledged many others, including other legislators and DHHL staff who worked diligently to move HB 2511 forward. "A $600 million infusion of funds to the Department would not only be historic but also provide the Department funding to gain momentum towards the fulfillment of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act." he said in a statement. -We anxiously await a positive outcome following a final floor vote in the coming days." In his nightly address, Zelenskyy condemned the strike, saying it revealed Russia's 'true attitude to global institutions" and was an effort to "humiliate the U.N." He vowed a 'strong response" to that and other Russian attacks. "We still have to drive the occupiers out," he said. Speaking at the White House, Biden rejected Russian suggestions that the United States was waging a proxy war against Moscow. "It shows the desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do in the first instance," Biden said. The massive aid package Biden unveiled Thursday would eclipse all the spending by the United States so far on the war. There is widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for more aid, but it remained uncertain whether the issue could get tied up in negotiations over ancillary issues like pandemic relief or immigration. The request, more than twice the size of the $13.6 billion package lawmakers approved and Biden signed in March, was intended to last through the end of Septen}- ber, underscoring the expectations of a prolonged conflict.

Joseph Lautenslager, who was relieved of command on April 28, 2021. Julian was the third watch stander over a three-year period known to have died on duty guarding a submarine undergoing maintenance at the shipyard. 1n December 2019, Seaman Gabriel Romero, a submariner assigned to the USS Columbia, killed two civihan workers and wounded another with a rifle before killing himself with his sidearm while on guard duty Shortly after, Hawaii News Now reported that a watch stander guarding the USS Chicago had taken his own life on duty just weeks before Romero. The Naval Criminal Investigation Service's probe into Julian's death remains one ing. NCIS spokesperson Jeff Houston said. however, that the investigation "is nearing completion. Out of respect for the investigative process, we cannot comment further while the investigation continues. Congress has pressed the Navy to act on military sulcides. In 2021 it passed the Brandon Act, named for Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Caserta, which aims to reduce the stigma around reporting mental health issues. The 21-yearold aviation electrician killed himself in 2018 by lunging into the rotor blades of a lielicopler after repeated bullying and hazing. The legislation named alt ter him calls for service members to be able to seek help confidentially, including outside their chain of command if they choose. It also requires a mental health evaluation as soon as a service member self-reports. Caserta's father, Patrick Caserta, a Navy veteran who pushed for passage of the bill and is one of the founders of the Brandon Caserta Foundation. said the milltary needs to take a proactive approach to helping service members in crisis. 'That's what the Brandon Act does," he said. "Of course, if it's ever implemented." Caserta said the deaths of the Pearl Harbor watch standers at the same facility in such a short time should be a "red flag" to Navy officials. All toxic abusive cornmands and leadership have common themes," he said. WHILE the NCIS probe of Julian's death remains open, the author of the investigation into the command climate aboard the USS Charlotte wrote, "All of the sailors that 1 spoke with felt that the command does not 0. r 'l have their interest at heart. Almost entirely across the board sailors had little to no trust that their concerns were being heard." The investigator noted complaints about poor management, exhausted crew. allegations of racism and suspected alcoholism, and alluded to a sailor pulling a gun on a crew mate - all of wlticli occurred before Juhan's death. The Navy released its investigation into the deadly December 2019 shipyard shooting to the public with minimal redactions. After that incident, Navy officials promised reforms. including improved mental health care, better training and more accountability for leaders. The report into the Charlotte command climate included portions evaluating how the Pacific Submarine Force had gone about incorporating lessons from the 2019 tragedy, but those portions were redacted and cited documents not included. The Navy redacted all portions related to the investigator's recommendations in the version of the document released to the Star-Advertiser, and officials have not provided information on the nature of the recommendations after repeated inquiries. The Navy also did not answer questions about whether it has made any changes to guard duty or weapons handling procedures in light of the recent deaths. However, the unredacted portions of the investigation show parallels between the circumstances leading up to the December 2019 shooting at Columbia's dry dock and Julian's death, namely a disorganized leadership overseeing a submarine under maintenance with a demoralized and angry crew. The author of the investigation into the Charlotte wrote that "junior sailors do not feel that there is a consolidated message of what their purpose is or what the priorities are for them" and that "sailors do not feel valued or included in the workplace on board." The investigator noted that members of the Charlotte's crew were "extremely frustrated that they have no plan and their workday normally will not start until late in the afternoon," and "all sailors I spoke to said they never know what time they are going home when they come in at the beginning of the day. The investigator said the leadership style aboard the Charlotte left sailors "little flexibility to conduct work or maintenance planning on their own" and noted that "this was personally observed during the investigation." The investigator also raised concerns that leadership essentially trapped crew members aboard the Charlotte, giving them little guidance as to what they were expected to do. 'A significant number of personnel that I spoke with have been denied leave and told 'there's no time,'" the investigator wrote. "The (Engineering Department Master Chief) has been referenced Petty Officer 3rd Class Mam on March 15.2021. while on 101 Sl tei O1 KUPONO SOLAR COMMUNITY MEETING NOTICE KDpono Solar, a proposed renewable solar energy project, will bring 42 megawattsof clean energy with a four-hour battery energy storagesystem, enough to power 10,000 homes on 0'ahu duringthe day ornight. The project has been selected by Hawaiian Electric Companyand is proposed by Bright Canyon Energy and Ameresco to be located on under-utilized land stander- for the USS Char dock at Pearl Harbor. The officer. Cmdr. Joseph Lau was relieved of command several times as the source for saying leave will not be allowed." Pointing out common denominators, Caserta said, "When you are in a cornmand who clearly doesn't care about the crew. no one wants to be there. You think of ways to take leave or transfer out of there. The chain of command blocks your way out. and the under-crew issue is their created problem.... This is people in a corner. They have no way out." THE FINDINGS on the USS Charlotte mirror the issues aboard the USS Columbia in 2019, where sailors across the crew had complained of unpredictable schedules, a lack of planning, late working hours and last-minute tasks. The investigation of the 2019 shooting found that Nhe organizational culture tolerated a below-average command climate because USS Columbia was in an industrial environment." In a survey before the deadly December 2019 incident, an anonymous Columbia crew member wrote, "Not having a purpose and just being here to clean, we work in an industrial environment, you can only sweep the decks so much... often times I considering (sic) putting my pistol in my mouth and ending it all or just throwing myself into the dry dock basin." The Pacific Fleet's investiU.S. NAVY PHOTOS iel Julian was found dead i duty as an armed "watch tte, pictured above in dry ibmatine's commanding uslager, pictured at left, n April 28,2021. gation of the Columbia inchdent also concluded that Navy psychologists might feel pressured to underdiagnose mental issues among submariners to keep them on duty. The 2021 investigation of the Charlotte criticized the leaders on that submarine for their attitude toward the health, safety and mental well-being of the crew. The investigator noted a situation in which a sailor pointed a gun at another sailor "was never adequately addressed with the crew." The version of the report released to the Star-Advertiser offered no other details on the incident. The report also noted that "specifically, racism and discrimination comments have not been addressed," but did not elaborate. The report singled out a lack of communication, noting that "this is a pervasive problem that spans all ranks within the command and includes communication internally and externally with outside agencies," and that "sailors felt they do not get a clear message of what's going on at any time. The investigation said junior officers and department heads on the submarine "specifically identified that was at its worst" in the periods immediately after the deaths of two individuals, whose names the Navy redacted in the version of the report it released. "The command triad was completely'closed door' during that timeframe," the investigator wrote. "No direction was given from (Lautenslager) at that time to the officers. chiefs. or the crew." ALMOST a month after Julian's death, Lt. Cmdr. Russell Cruz, a supply officer assigned to the Naval Submarine Support Center at Pearl Harbor, took his own life during a standoff with police at the Kahala Hotel & Resort. The deaths of so many submarine force sailors in Hawaii over a relatively short period of time was noted in news coverage at the time. A report released in April by the Government Accountability Office concluded that service members stationed in places like Hawaii and Alaska, as well as several overseas installations defined as "remote," appeared to be at greater risk of attempting suicide than those stationed on the mainland. But troops on the mainland are not immune, particularly those working in shipyards. The Navy has struggled to maintain its fleets - which have been pushed to their limits as the Navy conducts global operations-with its aging shipyards. Keeping ships and subs running on a near-constant basis has also pushed sailors to the limit as they attempt to meet those demands and struggle with maintenance backlogs. In 2019 three sailors working aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush died by suicide while it was undergoing ali overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia. In late April the Navy acknowledged it is probing seven suicide deaths - four this year and three from 2019 and 2020 - of sailors assigned to the carrier USS George Washington, which has been undergoing its own years4ong overhaul in Newport News, Va. Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Russell Smith recently visited the crew of the George Washington for a question-andenswer session. According to a transcript released by the Navy, when a sailor asserted that crews working on vessel maintenance have higher rates of suicides and mental health issues. Smith replied, N would tell you anecdotally, I believe the same thing, I can't tell you if there's quantification of that, but it feels that way to me, too." owned bythe Department of Defense on the West Loch Annex. riban:i-aliibraitegde.sf.r Join us at an upcoming community meeting to learn more about our proposed project: .... . 0 T. . 1...

For entire life of project? Seller response: The Kupono Solar project will provide power for 20-years through its PPA with HECO. The power would be available during daylight hours from the photovoltaic solar panels and for an additional 4 hours after sundown. Ultimate dispatch of the facility will be controlled by HECO to suit the needs of its customers. 2. Question: What are specific benefits for the community? Seller response: Kupono Solar is soliciting input from the community on how best to allocate its community benefits package. The community benefits package is intended to support charitable organizations, science technology engineering math (STEM) education, and youth sports. 1. Question: Will you build your project before the bypass project? Response: The Kupono Solar Project is anticipated to be completed before the bypass road is constructed. 1. Question: Are there any alternate locations other than Ewa? Seller response: The Kupono Solar participated in an RFP for a lease on Department of Defense land located in the West Loch Annex of Pearl Harbor. No alternate locations were considered. 2. Question: Will the project be expanded to include the entire island of Oahu? Seller response: No 3. Question: Will there be a benefit from this project that will be received by the community? E.g., will the Ewa Beach homes be prioritized? Seller response: Benefits of the project will be clean renewable power and improved power quality. Additionally, Kupono Solar wants to help support the community as part of its community benefits package and is seeking input on how best to help. 1. Comment: Navy Lease extension comes up in 2033, large community is requesting that then Navy land be given back to Hawaii. 2. Question: Did someone from University of Hawaii perform cultural survey? Response: Cultural surveys were conducted as part of the Environmental Assessment. 3. Comment: This is going to an integrated board, is not giving any discount to community of Ewa Beach. 4. Question: How much will it save the community of Ewa Beach? Confidential Information Deleted Pursuant To Protective Order No. 38237. EXHIBIT G PAGE 35 OF 73 Response: The Kupono Solar Project will not directly save money for the residences of Ewa Beach, however, the fixed-price 20-year PPA may help prevent fluctuations in rates due to volatile prices of fossil fuels. 5. Question: Will it be union jobs or non-union jobs? Response: Kupono Solar is planning to use local union labor to the maximum extent practicable. 6. Comment: Not helping Ewa Beach. 1. Comment: Ewa is hosting this project but we are not receiving any actual benefit from this project. Question is to elected officials - there are other places to locate solar. 1. Question: Will you use union labor? Response: Kupono Solar plans to use union labor. 1. Comment: The cultural study is not appropriate. Wants another archaeological review of the space to ensure that there are no iwi kupuna in that space. 1. Comment: Will not benefit Ewa community. 2. Question: How will it benefit our community as a whole? Response: Kupono Solar is soliciting input from the community on how best to allocate its community benefits package. 1. Comment: You said you were going to support community. I don't care about the grid, I care about the community. 2. Question: How are you going to support the community? Response: Kupono Solar is soliciting input from the community on how best to allocate its community benefits package. 1. Comment: PRTF could be an alternate site for this project. There is an EIS open for a first responder campus up in Mililani. They will build a 100,000 sq ft shooting range. All agencies that shoot at PRTF will go up there. PRTF might be a better place for the solar farm. Confidential Information Deleted Pursuant To Protective Order No. 38237.

So this is a great idea to rebuild the lookout this National Wildlife Area. from Susan to Everyone: 8:09 PM I am always happy when there is more renewable energy being built on Oahu. We are responsible for our carbon footprint on planet Earth. from Susan to Everyone: 8:10 PM We are all in this together. from John to Everyone: 8:12 PM Great Idea Kathy. The slide mentioned STEM . 1 think anther idea is to allow middle schoolers to tour the facility on a regular basis. from Alexander to Everyone: 8:12 PM Development is inevitable. I'd rather have a solar project than many other alternatives. 1 cannot attend tomorrow's meeting, but the one thing I strongly encourage is that the solar project really does find direct ways to supports the local Ewa Beach community...not electrons...local initiatives from Kathleen to Everyone: 8:13 PM It might be helpful if they constructed a building on the site so visitors can be accommodated. from Alexander to Everyone: 8:15 PM Alsso, where is the access to the solar farm? As we all know, North Road could benefit from improvements from Kathleen to Everyone: 8:17 PM The purpose of the project is to provide cleaner energy. If Hawaiian Electric needs more electricity to power Oahu, they could chose several means to achieve that end. It isn't Confidential Information Deleted Pursuant To Protective Order No. 38237.

Same goes for other infrastructure like the waste management. Not to stop projects like this (i'm very supportive of this solar initiative) but thereshould also besome direct benefit forthe involved physical communities in additiontothe overall benefit forthe island - for any project. from Mike to Everyone: 8:26 PM https://files. hawaii.gov/dbedt/erp/Doc_Library/2022-05-08-OA-DE IS-First-ResponderTechnology-Campus-Volume-1.pdf from Alexander to Everyone: 8:27 PM Agreed Jannah, well said from Ku'u to Everyone: 8:28 PM Lanai's got a huge solar project coming and they are going to give customers credits, depending on their buy-in.

Congratu lations on youi· selection. l'he Alliance's primary purpose is to ensure that construction projects in the State of Hawaii are built by local residents who are high ly skilled and trained in construction methods and project safety, and that employers on such projects pay an adequate living wage. The labor unions affiliated with the Alliance take great pride in their comprehensive, multi-year apprenticeship programs. which train hundreds of young Hawaiians in construction work annually, Apprentices enrolled in union programs receive rigorous safety training, on the job and in the classrooin, and apprenticeship programs prioritize worksite safety given the inherently dangerous nature of construction work. Crucially, this significant investment in local apprenticeship requires a reliable training-to-employment pipeline for local residents. The Alliance also supports a sustainable middle-class wage for construction workers. This is crucial to breaking the cycle of poverty and maintaining adequate wage standards for construction workers, where otherwise they may fall victim to wage theft, which is rampant in the construction industry. For these important reasons, the Alliance is not able to support construction projects where there is no demonstrated commitment to using contractors who employ local residents and apprentices and pay them a sustainable-middle class wage. Such projects are opposed by the Alliance before governmental permitting and approval boards. The Alliance respectfully requests that Bright Canyon Energy demonstrate its commitment to the aforementioned principles and values by executing the attached Memorandum of Agreement, which will promote project efficiency, support local residents, and increase investment in the Hawaiian economy. The Alliance looks forward to partnering withl Bright Canyon Energy to construct a high-quality renewable energy project. Confidential Information Deleted Pursuant To Protective Order No. 38237.

Decommissioning includes attention to surrounding 4 factors to minimize effects such as erosion during the removal process. All materials will be removed, and the equipment will be reused, recycled or disposed of off island. What is status of permitting? 5 The project is proposed on Navy land, and the Navy will facilitate the necessary National Environmental Policy Act permitting requirements. The Navy completed a Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact in 2015 in support of solar and battery development at this location. We will utilize a qualified, third-party consulting firm that has experience in Hawai'i and federal processes to ensure strict adherence to all permits and environmental and cultural resource requirements. Are there any hazardous materials on your identified There are no known hazardous materials on the site. solar site?

What is the status of interconnection? 13 14 Has an initial study been completed? Given recent news about utility solar projects going bankrupt in western states, what guarantees will the local community have if you (or the project) goes bankrupt in regards to continued project operation or removal from the site? 15 Will any Hawaiian made produds be utilized? 16 What percentage of your contractors (or suppliers) will be Hawaiian firms (as opposed to mainland 17 firrns)? 18 How many construction jobs will you be utilizing for the project? Will these construction jobs be "prevailing wage" 19 and/or subject to any collective bargaining agreements? What sorts of insurance binders will the project hold 20 in case a hurricane blows one of your solar panels into my house? EXHIBIT G PAGE 57 OF 73 The project access point has not yet been determined nor a specific route to be used for delivery of materials so traffic control measures have not yet been identified. It is not anticipated that construction vehicles will cause any damage to roadways in the area. BCE has submitted an interconnection application; Hawaiian Electric will study the Project to determine the necessary facilities to safely and reliably connect the Project to the existing grid. An initial study has not been completed. BCE is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE: PNW) headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. With consolidated assets of $18 billion, Pinnacle West and its affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses for more than 130 years. PNW has a strong balance sheet and is currently rated A- by Standard and Poors. BCE is well-positioned to ensure completion of the project as well as provide longterm operations and maintenance support. BCE is committed to being an excellent steward of the project for the community. Major equipment and supplies such as, but not limited to, cement, solar panels, inverters, batteries, transformers, steel and wiring will be sourced competitively from various production facilities both locally and around the world. Evaluation criteria will include cost, availability and applicability of using materials. Where possible, local supplies will be sourced. BCE is still in the process of selecting contractors. We plan to maximize use of local construction contractors. It is anticipated that local construction contractors will be utilized. The number will vary with the specific activities but is expected to be between 40-150. BCE anticipates paying prevailing wage. Insurance for the project will meet requirements in the PPA and BCE corporate standards. Confidential Information Deleted Pursuant To Protective Order No. 38237.
