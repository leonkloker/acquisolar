11. DESCRIPTION OF APPLICANT
Applicant is a Hawaii not-for-profit electric cooperative, whose principal place of
business is 4463 Pahe'e Street, Ste. 1, Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii 96766-2000. Applicant is
2

an operating public utility engaged in the production, transmission, distribution,
purchase, and sale of electric energy on the island of Kaual, State of Hawaii. Applicant
has been an operating public utility since November 1, 2002, when it purchased
substantially all of the assets and assumed the operations of the Kauai Electric division
of Citizens Communications Company ("Citizens"), and in connection therewith, was
assigned the legislatively-granted franchise2 previously held by Citizens to manufacture,
sell, furnish, and supply electric light, current, and power on the island of Kauai. Said
transaction was approved by the Commission in Decision and Order No. 19658, filed
on September 17,2002, as amended by Decision and Order No. 19755, filed on
October 30,2002, both in Docket No. 02-0060.
Applicant is duly incorporated, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Hawaii.
111. BACKGROUND OF KAPAA SOLAR AND THE FACILITY
Kapaa Solar is a manager-managed Hawaii limited liability company. Kurt
Bosshard, a resident of Kauai, is the sole member and manager of Kapaa Solar. Kapaa
Solar will construct and operate an approximately 1 megawattac ("MWac")3 photovoltaic
generation plant (the "Facility"). The Facility's estimated annual energy production from
2011 through 2035 is as set forth in Exhibit 2, attached hereto. The Facility will be
located on Lot No. 2 of the parcel of land located on Olohena Road, Kapaa, State of
2 Act 134, Sessions Laws of Hawaii 1961, as amended by Act 165, Session Laws of
Hawaii 1967.
3 Note that the PPA describes the Facility in terms of its direct current (DC) peak power rating
(Le, the PPA describes the Facility as a 1.1844 MWpdc photovoltaic system). In terms of alternating
current (AC) capacity, the Facility's capacity is 1 MWac· In other words, taking into account losses caused
by, eg, dirt on panels, output reduction due to ambient and panel temperature, conductor losses, inverter
efficiency losses, etc., the 1.1844 MWPdc Facility's peak capacity will be 1 M\Nac
3

Hawaii, and more particularly identified by Tax Map Key No. (4) 4-3-003-001, as shown
on Exhibit 3, attached hereto.

Rate described above.16 The Interconnection Agreement will also contain certain
indemnity and insurance provisions similar to provisions in the PPA.
1. Conditions Precedent and Termination Rights: The Parties agreed to a
number of conditions precedent in the PPA, including a provision for KIUC to timely
exercise its right to seek certain approvals (e.g., approvals from the Commission, Rural
Utility Service, and Cooperative Finance Corporation), or else waive certain rights to
terminate the PPA.17 Additional rights to terminate the PPA are contained in
Section 6 and Appendix C of the PPA, which includes, among other things, automatic
termination of the PPA in the event certain sought after approvals (including
Commission approval) are not received on or before twelve (12) months from the date
of execution of the PPA, despite KIUC's timely and commercially reasonable efforts.18
V. REQUESTS FOR APPROVAL AND AUTHORIZATION
A. APPROVAL OF PPA AND ENERGY CHARGES
HRS § 269-27.2(c) provides, in relevant part, that the "rate payable by the public
utility to the producer for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity supplied to the public
utility shall be as agreed between the public utility and the supplier and as approved by
the public utilities commission.
.19 As indicated above and stated in more detail in the
16 PPA, Section 2, at 3-4,
17 li, Section 6, at 5-6.
18 li, Appendix C of the PPA.
" HAR § 6-74-22(a) also provides that the rates for purchase shall be just and reasonable and
not discriminate against Other small power producers. However, HAR § 6-74-15(b)(1) states that nothing
in HAR Title 6, Chapter 74, Subchapter 3 (i.e., HAR §§ 6-74-15 to 28) "[plrohibits an electric utility or any
qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase,
which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subchapter."
7

PPA, the Parties have agreed to energy charges for the delivery of energy for sale to
KIUC calculated as described in Part IV.C of this Application above. KIUC's financial
models indicate that such energy charge is a reasonable rate, as it is lower than the
cost KIUC could achieve through direct ownership of a photovoltaic facility. This type of
energy charge has been previously approved by the Commission in other
proceedings.20 The energy charges are in compliance with HRS § 269-27.2(c).21
Accordingly, KIUC contends that these energy charges are just and reasonable, and are
consistent with HRS § 269-27.2 and the applicable provisions of HAR Chapter 6-74.
Furthermore, the specific terms and conditions of the PPA, as summarized above and
provided in Exhibit 1, were negotiated by the Parties at arms-length and contain
indemnification, insurance, and other provisions which will serve to protect KIUC and its
members/customers from certain risks associated with interconnecting with Kapaa
Solar's Facility. Moreover, the terms and conditions of the PPA and the Interconnection
Agreement will not affect KIUC's ability to provide electric service to its
20 See In the Matter of the Application of Hawaii Electric Light Con,oany, Inc. for Approval of
Power Purchase Contract with Keahole Solar Power LLC and Approval to Include the Purchase Enemy
Costs in Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc.'s Enerav Cost Adiustment Clause, Docket No. 2008-0186,
Decision and Order (November 28,2008), where the Commission approved a fixed rate pricing structure
(with a 1.25% annual increase applied for each of the last nine years of the term) for a power purchase
contract with a ten-year term. However, in the case of KIUC's PPA with Kapaa Solar, the Energy Rate
will not increase for the first twenty years of the term of the PPA.
21 HRS § 269-27.2(c) states the following, in relevant part:
The commission's determination of the just and reasonable rate shall be
accomplished by establishing a methodology that removes or
significantly reduces any linkage between the price of fossil fuels and the
rate for the nonfossil fuel generated electricity to potentially enable utility
customers to share in the benefits of fuel cost savings resulting from the
use of nonfossil fuel generated electricity. As the commission deems
appropriate, the just and reasonable rate for nonfossil fuel generated
electricity supplied to the public utility by the producer may include
mechanisms for reasonable and appropriate incremental adjustments,
such as adjustments linked to consumer price indices for inflation or
other acceptable adjustment mechanisms.
8

members/customers and are not discriminatory to other small power producers that are
similarly situated. For these reasons, KIUC requests Commission approval of the PPA.
KIUC also requests that the Commission find that the purchased energy charges
to be paid by KIUC pursuant to the PPA are just and reasonable and that the purchased
power arrangements (e.g., terms and conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which
KIUC purchases energy from Kapaa Solar, are prudent and in the public interest.
B. AUTHORIZATION TO INCLUDE PURCHASED ENERGY IN ERAC
HAR § 6-60-6(2) provides that "[n]0 changes in fuel and purchased energy Costs
may be included in the fuel adjustment clause unless the contracts or prices for the
purchase of such fuel or energy have been previously approved or filed with the
commjssion." KIUC presently implements a fuel adjustment clause (aka ERAC) through
its applicable rate schedules set forth in Tariff No. 1 to recover fuel and purchased
energy costs previously approved by the Commission. For the same reasons discussed
in Section V.A. above, KIUC also requests Commission approval to include all of the
purchased energy charges (and related revenue taxes) that are incurred under the PPA
with Kapaa Solar in KIUC's ERAC for the term of the PPA.
C. INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING ("IRP") CONSIDERATIONS
The Commission's IRP Framework, Paragraph 111.D.5, states, in relevant part,
that "[t]he integrated resource plan and program implementation schedule approved by
the commission shall govern all utility expenditures for capital projects, purchased
9

power, and demand-side management programs.
„22
The Commission further
elaborated on the issue of "purchased power" by stating that an IRP "is also intended to
'control, direct, or strongly influence' all power purchases.,23 The Commission further
explained:
First, purchased power is itself a resource option that may be
considered by a utility in fashioning an integrated resource plan.
Even if not considered in resource planning or included in an
integrated resource plan, power that a utility may be required to
purchase under PURPA or State statute or under this commission's
or FERC's rules should be reviewed in light of the utility's integrated
resource plan and contractual provisions fashioned, to the extent
possible, to retain the integrity of the resource plan. Further, any
power purchased must eventually be incorporated into a utility's
integrated resource plan.24
KIUC's predecessor submitted its 2nd IRP in Docket No. 96-0266 and KIUC's yd IRP
was filed on December 18,2008 in Docket No. 2006-0165. Neither the 2nd IRP nor the
3rd IRP specifically addresses the purchased power contemplated by KIUC pursuant to
the PPA with Kapaa Solar, primarily due to the fact that, at the time such IRPs were
being developed, KIUC was not aware of this project. However, the integration of solar
photovoltaic energy into KIUC's system is not inconsistent with KIUC's 3rd IRP, filed in
2008, which recognizes the need for KIUC to meet its statutory Renewable Portfolio
22 The IRP Framework, formally known as A Framework for Integrated Resource Planning,
originated from the Commission's proceeding in Docket No. 6617 (emphasis added). The Commission, in
Docket No. 6617, conducted a proceeding to establish rules and principles that Hawaii energy utilities
would follow in performing IRP. See Docket No. 6617, Decision and Order No. 11523, filed on March 12,
1992 ('Decision and Order No. 11523"), as amended by Decision and Order No. 11630, filed on May 22,
1992 ('Decision and Order No. 11630")
23 Decision and Order No, 11630, at 9.

Standard ("RPS") obligations.25 KIUC contends that the PPA with Kapaa Solar was
executed to be consistent with PURPA and the State's RPS, as set forth in HRS
§§ 269-91 et seq., as well as KIUC's own Strategic Plan.26 Thus, for these reasons,
KIUC also requests a waiver of Paragraph 111.D.5 of the IRP Framework, to the extent
necessary and applicable.27 KIUC contends that such IRP requirement would be
impracticable and inappropriate to implement given the circumstances described above.
VI.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, Applicant hereby respectfully requests that the
Commission issue a decision and order:
1. Approving the PPA, pursuant to HRS § 269-27.2, as further described
above and attached hereto as Exhibit 1,
2. Finding that the purchased energy charges to be paid by KIUC pursuant to
the PPA are just and reasonable;
3. Finding that the purchased power arrangements (e.g., terms and
conditions) under the PPA, pursuant to which KIUC purchases energy from Kapaa
Solar, are prudent and in the public interest;
25 Pursuant to the Commission's Order Denying Request to Suspend Proceeding and Closing
Docket filed on February 18, 2009, KIUC was ordered to suspend all activities pursuant to the IRP
Framework. The Commission is treating KIUC's 3rd IRP as having the status of a plan filed with, but not
approved by, the Commission. KIUC's next planning cycle will be determined by the outcome of Docket
No. 2009-0108, in which the Commission is investigating proposed amendments to the IRP Framework.
26 KIUC'S Strategic Plan includes, among other things, the movement towards energy
independence and decreased reljance on foreign imported on by meeting at least fifty percent (50%) of
KIUC's annual electricity sales with energy generated by renewable resources by 2023.
27 See Decision and Order No. 11523 (stating, among other things, that "a utility may, at any
time, request a waiver from the commission" and that the "utility seeking such a waiver will have the
burden of showing, to the commission's satisfaction, that compliance with the requirement is impossible,
impracticable, in appropriate, or economically infeasible").
11

5. Authorizing, pursuant to HAR § 6-60-6(2), the inclusion of all of the
purchased energy charges (and related revenue taxes) to be incurred by KIUC under
the PPA in KIUC's ERAC;
6. Granting a waiver of Paragraph 111.D.5 of the IRP Framework, to the extent
necessary and applicable; and
7. Granting such other relief as may be just and reasonable under the
circumstances.

all
reasonable
efforts
to
ensure
such
Environmental Credits are vested in the Cooperative,
and shall execute all documents, including, but not
limited to, documents transferring such Environmental

without
further
compensation,
provided
however, that the Cooperative agrees to pay for all
reasonable and preauthorized costs associated with
such efforts and/or documentation.
(S)
PURPA Waiver.
Seller acknowledges this Agreement as a
source of compensation and hereby waives any present
or future Qualified Facility <QF) status under PURPA
or otherwise during the initial term of this Agreement
and any extensions.
(t)
Income Tax Credits. Existing
Federal
and
State
tax
credits are reflected in the price to be paid for
energy under this Agreement, and the existence of
extensions of or modifications to tax credits or tax
laws and regulations will not result in changes to
that price.
